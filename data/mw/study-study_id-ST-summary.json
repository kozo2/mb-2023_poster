Disease resistant rice cultivars are the most economical way to combat the disease. The TP309 cultivar is susceptible to infection by Xoo strain PXO99. A transgenic variety, TP309_Xa21, expresses the pattern recognition receptor Xa21, and is resistant. PXO99?raxST, a strain lacking the raxST gene, is able to overcome Xa21-mediated immunity. We used a single extraction solvent to demonstrate comprehensive metabolomics and transcriptomics profiling under sample limited conditions, and analyze the molecular responses of two rice lines challenged with either PXO99 or PXO99?raxST. LCTOF raw data file filtering resulted in better within group reproducibility of replicate samples for statistical analyses. Accurate mass match compound identification with molecular formula generation (MFG) ranking of 355 masses was achieved with the METLIN database. GCTOF analysis yielded an additional 441 compounds after BinBase database processing, of which 154 were structurally identified by retention index\/MS library matching. Multivariate statistics revealed that the susceptible and resistant genotypes possess distinct profiles. Although few mRNA and metabolite differences were detected in PXO99 challenged TP309 compared to mock, many differential changes occurred in the Xa21-mediated response to PXO99 and PXO99?raxST. Acetophenone, xanthophylls, fatty acids, alkaloids, glutathione, carbohydrate and lipid biosynthetic pathways were affected. Significant transcriptional induction of several pathogenesis related genes in Xa21 challenged strains, as well as differential changes to GAD, PAL, ICL1 and Glutathione-S-transferase transcripts indicated limited correlation with metabolite changes under single time point global profiling conditions.","subject_species":"Oryza sativa Japonica Group"},"8":{"study_id":"ST000009","study_title":"Mixed meal tolerance","study_type":"MS analysis","institute":"University of Michigan","department":"","last_name":"Burant","first_name":"Chuck","email":"burantc@umich.edu","phone":"","submit_date":"2013-03-27","study_summary":"Meal test of bariatric surgery patients before and after weight loss","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"9":{"study_id":"ST000010","study_title":"Lung Cancer Cells 4","study_type":"MS analysis (Untargeted)","institute":"University of Michigan","department":"","last_name":"Keshamouni","first_name":"Venkat","email":"vkeshamo@umich.edu","phone":"","submit_date":"2013-04-03","study_summary":"In cancer cells, the process of epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT) confers migratory and invasive capacity, resistance to apoptosis, drug resistance, evasion of host immune surveillance and tumor stem cell traits. Cells undergoing EMT may represent tumor cells with metastatic potential. Characterizing the EMT secretome may identify biomarkers to monitor EMT in tumor progression and provide a prognostic signature to predict patient survival. Utilizing a transforming growth factor-\u03b2-induced cell culture model of EMT, we quantitatively profiled differentially secreted proteins, by GeLC-tandem mass spectrometry. Integrating with the corresponding transcriptome, we derived an EMT-associated secretory phenotype (EASP) comprising of proteins that were differentially upregulated both at protein and mRNA levels. Four independent primary tumor-derived gene expression data sets of lung cancers were used for survival analysis by the random survival forests (RSF) method. Analysis of 97-gene EASP expression in human lung adenocarcinoma tumors revealed strong positive correlations with lymph node metastasis, advanced tumor stage and histological grade. RSF analysis built on a training set (n = 442), including age, sex and stage as variables, stratified three independent lung cancer data sets into low-, medium- and high-risk groups with significant differences in overall survival. We further refined EASP to a 20 gene signature (rEASP) based on variable importance scores from RSF analysis. Similar to EASP, rEASP predicted survival of both adenocarcinoma and squamous carcinoma patients. More importantly, it predicted survival in the early-stage cancers. These results demonstrate that integrative analysis of the critical biological process of EMT provides mechanism-based and clinically relevant biomarkers with significant prognostic value.\nResearch is published, core data not used but project description is relevant:\nhttp:\/\/www.jimmunol.org\/content\/194\/12\/5789.long\n","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"10":{"study_id":"ST000011","study_title":"African Metabolomics","study_type":"MS analysis","institute":"University of Michigan","department":"","last_name":"Thompson","first_name":"Simon","email":"simontho@upenn.edu","phone":"","submit_date":"2013-04-04","study_summary":"Compare metabolomic, phenotypic and genetic diversity across various groups of Africans.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"11":{"study_id":"ST000012","study_title":"Extraction Optimization Study","study_type":"Solvent treatment","institute":"University of California, Davis","department":"Davis Genome Center","last_name":"Kind","first_name":"Tobias","email":"tkind@ucdavis.edu","phone":"","submit_date":"2013-05-20","study_summary":"Steel Ball\/ Glass bead + Chloroform\/ Isopropanol treatment","subject_species":"Chlamydomonas reinhardtii"},"12":{"study_id":"ST000013","study_title":"Mutation Study","study_type":"Genotype","institute":"University of California, Davis","department":"Davis Genome Center","last_name":"Kind","first_name":"Tobias","email":"tkind@ucdavis.edu","phone":"","submit_date":"2013-05-20","study_summary":"This experiment tests the effect of individual mutations on the metabolome of Arabidopsis.

Here we show using an integrated phosphoproteomic and metabolomic strategy that NPM-ALK induces a metabolic shift toward aerobic glycolysis, increased lactate production, and biomass production. The metabolic shift is mediated through the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) phosphorylation of the tumor-specific isoform of pyruvate kinase (PKM2) at Y105, resulting in decreased enzymatic activity. Small molecule activation of PKM2 or expression of Y105F PKM2 mutant leads to reversal of the metabolic switch with increased oxidative phosphorylation and reduced lactate production coincident with increased cell death, decreased colony formation, and reduced tumor growth in an in vivo xenograft model. This study provides comprehensive profiling of the phosphoproteomic and metabolomic consequences of NPM-ALK expression and reveals a novel role of ALK in the regulation of multiple components of cellular metabolism. Our studies show that PKM2 is a novel substrate of ALK and plays a critical role in mediating the metabolic shift toward biomass production and tumorigenesis.\nResearch is published:\nhttp:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3739039\/\n","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"16":{"study_id":"ST000017","study_title":"Rat HCR\/LCR Stamina Study","study_type":"LC-MS analysis (Untargeted)","institute":"University of Michigan","department":"Internal Medicine","last_name":"Qi","first_name":"Nathan","email":"nathanqi@med.umich.edu","phone":"734-232-0815","submit_date":"2013-09-24","study_summary":"Maximal exercise-associated oxidative capacity is strongly correlated with health and longevity in humans. Rats selectively bred for high running capacity (HCR) have improved metabolic health and are longer-lived than their low-capacity counterparts (LCR). Using metabolomic and proteomic profiling, we show that HCR efficiently oxidize fatty acids (FAs) and branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), sparing glycogen and reducing accumulation of short- and medium-chain acylcarnitines. HCR mitochondria have reduced acetylation of mitochondrial proteins within oxidative pathways at rest, and there is rapid protein deacetylation with exercise, which is greater in HCR than LCR. Fluxomic analysis of valine degradation with exercise demonstrates a functional role of differential protein acetylation in HCR and LCR. Our data suggest that efficient FA and BCAA utilization contribute to high intrinsic exercise capacity and the health and longevity benefits associated with enhanced fitness.\nResearch is published, untargeted data not used in publication but project description is relevant:\nhttp:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1550413115000595\n","subject_species":"Rattus norvegicus"},"17":{"study_id":"ST000019","study_title":"Determine purity and quality of IROA labelled glucose","study_type":" NMR and MS analysis","institute":"University of Florida","department":"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology","last_name":"Stupp","first_name":"Gregory","email":"stuppie@ufl.edu","phone":"","submit_date":"2013-12-10","study_summary":"We demonstrate the global metabolic analysis ofCaenorhabditis elegansstress responses using a mass-spectrometry-based technique called isotopic ratio outlier analysis (IROA).

The lung compartment metabolome may detail the status of the local environment that could be useful in ARDS biomarker discovery and the identification of drug target opportunities. However, neither the utility of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) as a biofluid for metabolomics nor the optimal analytical platform for metabolite identification are established. To address this, we undertook a study to compare metabolites in BALF samples from patients with ARDS and healthy controls using a newly developed liquid chromatography (LC)-mass spectroscopy (MS) platform for untargeted metabolomics. Following initial testing of three different high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) columns, we determined that reversed phase (RP)-LC and hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC), were the most informative chromatographic methods because they yielded the most and highest quality data. Following confirmation of metabolite identification, statistical analysis resulted in 37 differentiating metabolites in the BALF of ARDS compared with health across both analytical platforms. Pathway analysis revealed networks associated with amino acid metabolism, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, fatty acid biosynthesis, phospholipids and purine metabolism in the ARDS BALF. The complementary analytical platforms of RPLC and HILIC-LC generated informative, insightful metabolomics data of the ARDS lung environment.\nResearch is published:\nhttp:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4068805\/\n","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"38":{"study_id":"ST000043","study_title":"MDA-MB-231 cells and p38 gamma knockdown","study_type":"","institute":"University of Michigan","department":"Biomedical Research Core Facilities","last_name":"Kachman","first_name":"Maureen","email":" mkachman@umich.edu","phone":"","submit_date":"2014-03-22","study_summary":"Compare highly motile MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with less motile, yet highly proliferative gamma p38 knockdowns","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"39":{"study_id":"ST000044","study_title":"Pilot experiment looking for the existence of certain molecules in pancreatic cancer cells","study_type":"","institute":"University of Michigan","department":"Biomedical Research Core Facilities","last_name":"Kachman","first_name":"Maureen","email":" mkachman@umich.edu","phone":"","submit_date":"2014-03-22","study_summary":"Pilot experiment looking for the existence of certain molecules in pancreatic cancer cells","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"40":{"study_id":"ST000045","study_title":"Plasma metabolomics:  Comparison of non-diabetic controls with T1D patients","study_type":"Drug effect study","institute":"Mayo Clinic","department":"Endocrinology","last_name":"Nair","first_name":"Sreekumaran","email":"Dasari.Surendra@mayo.edu","phone":"","submit_date":"2014-03-24","study_summary":"Non-diabetic controls whose metabolites were compared to T1D patients with and without insulin.

Because elephant seals have evolved robust physiological mechanisms that have allowed them to naturally tolerate such protracted bouts of fasting, they provide an ideal model to address our central hypothesis that increased lipid utilization late in the fast contributes to insulin resistance in elephant seals. Insulin resistance is a common consequence of fasting in mammals and, while the mechanisms by which it manifests are still unclear, a metabolic shift favoring increased mobilization and utilization of lipids during prolonged food deprivation may be a principal causative factor. Insulin resistance has a negative connotation due to its association with obesity and diabetes among humans, but it has been suggested to be an adaptive response to food deprivation.","subject_species":"Mirounga angustirostris"},"44":{"study_id":"ST000049","study_title":"Metabolomics Analysis of Thermally Challenged Mayfly Larvae (NMR analysis)","study_type":"Metabolomic analysis of mayflies","institute":"University of North Carolina","department":"Discovery Science Technology","last_name":"Sumner","first_name":"Susan","email":"susan_sumner\r\n@unc.edu","phone":"704-250-5066","submit_date":"2014-02-28","study_summary":"The purpose of this study was to examine the metabolic profiles of mayfly (Centroptilum triangulifer) larvae subjected to thermal challenge.

The past few years have highlighted the role of altered metabolism in cancer. While mechanistic insight into changed metabolism in cancer is very limited, the importance of the metabolic pathway surrounding homocysteine and methionine for cancer cell proliferation has been known for over 30 years. These findings, generally summarized as methionine-dependence or methionine stress\u00a0sensitivity, describe the phenomenon that most cancer cells cannot proliferate in growth medium where the amino acid methionine is replaced with its direct metabolic precursor homocysteine. Importantly, non-tumorigenic cells are unaffected by replacing methionine with homocysteine in the growth medium. For the past years we have been studying methionine dependence of breast and prostate cancer and demonstrated that methionine-dependence is caused by insufficient flux through this pathway to sustain synthesis of the downstream metabolite and the principal methyl-donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). We have isolated rare cell clones from MDA-MB468 breast cancer cells (referred to as MB468RES) that are no longer methionine dependent and proliferate in homocysteine medium. Interestingly, MB468RES have lost their ability for anchorage independent growth, a hallmark of cancer. The MB468 and MB468RES cell line pair confirms other observations showing that methionine dependence is tightly linked to tumorigenicity. Importantly, this cell line pair is an ideal model to identify metabolite signatures linked to cancer cell methionine dependence. We propose to characterize the metabolic changes triggered by the shift from normal growth medium to homocysteine medium in MB468 breast cancer cells and the methionine stress insensitive MB468RES derivatives. In addition we have developed cancer cell lines with inducible shRNAs targeting methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT), the enzyme catalyzing synthesis of SAM from methionine and ATP. Inducible knockdown of MAT allows us to specifically reduce SAM synthesis. Our previous results suggest that SAM limitation is the critical trigger for cancer cell methionine dependence. Thus metabolite profiling using the MAT knockdown system will provide an independent dataset that together with metabolite profiles from the MB468 and MB468RES cell line pair will define critical metabolic profiles related to cancer cell methionine dependence. \u00a0 In the current investigation, untargeted analysis of primary metabolites and complex lipids, coupled with quantitative analysis of methionine pathway intermediates (folate and respective derivatives, s-adenosylmethoinine, s-adenosylhomocysteine, choline, betaine) and metabolic flux will be conducted on MB468, MB468RES and MB468shRNA following the switch from methionine containing media to homocysteine containing media over the course of 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 hours. \u00a0 The primary objectives were to 1) characterize the metabolic response to methionine stress and SAM limitation and 2) correlate the metabolic signatures with cancer cell proliferation arrest and death.\u00a0 ","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"52":{"study_id":"ST000061","study_title":"Metabolic Profiling of Visceral and Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue from Colorectal Cancer Patients: GC-TOF MS analyis of subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue samples","study_type":"biomarker study","institute":"University of California, Davis","department":"Genome and Biomedical Sciences Facility","last_name":"Fiehn","first_name":"Oliver","email":"ofiehn@ucdavis.edu","phone":"(530) 754-8258","submit_date":"2014-06-11","study_summary":"This West Coast Metabolomics Center pilot and feasibility project  was granted to  Johanna Lampe (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center at Univ. of Washington, Seattle).

The past few years have highlighted the role of altered metabolism in cancer. While mechanistic insight into changed metabolism in cancer is very limited, the importance of the metabolic pathway surrounding homocysteine and methionine for cancer cell proliferation has been known for over 30 years. These findings, generally summarized as methionine-dependence or methionine stress\u00a0sensitivity, describe the phenomenon that most cancer cells cannot proliferate in growth medium where the amino acid methionine is replaced with its direct metabolic precursor homocysteine. Importantly, non-tumorigenic cells are unaffected by replacing methionine with homocysteine in the growth medium. For the past years we have been studying methionine dependence of breast and prostate cancer and demonstrated that methionine-dependence is caused by insufficient flux through this pathway to sustain synthesis of the downstream metabolite and the principal methyl-donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). We have isolated rare cell clones from MDA-MB468 breast cancer cells (referred to as MB468RES) that are no longer methionine dependent and proliferate in homocysteine medium. Interestingly, MB468RES have lost their ability for anchorage independent growth, a hallmark of cancer. The MB468 and MB468RES cell line pair confirms other observations showing that methionine dependence is tightly linked to tumorigenicity. Importantly, this cell line pair is an ideal model to identify metabolite signatures linked to cancer cell methionine dependence. We propose to characterize the metabolic changes triggered by the shift from normal growth medium to homocysteine medium in MB468 breast cancer cells and the methionine stress insensitive MB468RES derivatives. In addition we have developed cancer cell lines with inducible shRNAs targeting methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT), the enzyme catalyzing synthesis of SAM from methionine and ATP. Inducible knockdown of MAT allows us to specifically reduce SAM synthesis. Our previous results suggest that SAM limitation is the critical trigger for cancer cell methionine dependence. Thus metabolite profiling using the MAT knockdown system will provide an independent dataset that together with metabolite profiles from the MB468 and MB468RES cell line pair will define critical metabolic profiles related to cancer cell methionine dependence. \u00a0 In the current investigation, untargeted analysis of primary metabolites and complex lipids, coupled with quantitative analysis of methionine pathway intermediates (folate and respective derivatives, s-adenosylmethoinine, s-adenosylhomocysteine, choline, betaine) and metabolic flux will be conducted on MB468, MB468RES and MB468shRNA following the switch from methionine containing media to homocysteine containing media over the course of 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 hours. \u00a0 The primary objectives were to 1) characterize the metabolic response to methionine stress and SAM limitation and 2) correlate the metabolic signatures with cancer cell proliferation arrest and death.\u00a0 ","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"65":{"study_id":"ST000081","study_title":"Metabolic Profiling of Visceral and Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue from Colorectal Cancer Patients: UHPLC-QTOF MS analyis of subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue samples","study_type":"biomarker study","institute":"University of California, Davis","department":"Genome and Biomedical Sciences Facility","last_name":"Fiehn","first_name":"Oliver","email":"ofiehn@ucdavis.edu","phone":"(530) 754-8258","submit_date":"2014-06-11","study_summary":"This West Coast Metabolomics Center pilot and feasibility project  was granted to  Johanna Lampe (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center at Univ. of Washington, Seattle).

Here, we used genome-scale modeling and multi-omics (transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) analysis to assess metabolic features that are critical for macrophage activation. A genome-scale metabolic network for the RAW 264.7 cell line was constructed to determine metabolic modulators of activation. Metabolites well-known to be associated with immunoactivation (glucose and arginine) and immunosuppression (tryptophan and vitamin D3) were among the most critical effectors. Intracellular metabolic mechanisms were assessed, identifying a suppressive role for de-novo nucleotide synthesis. Finally, underlying metabolic mechanisms of macrophage activation were identified by analyzing multi-omic data obtained from LPS-stimulated RAW cells in the context of our flux-based predictions. This study demonstrates that the role of metabolism in regulating activation may be greater than previously anticipated and elucidates underlying connections between activation and metabolic effectors.

The disorder typically has its onset at puberty with evidence of excessive androgen production, obesity, and insulin resistance. Women with PCOS are more insulin resistant than weight-matched controls and have an exceptionally high prevalence of early-onset impaired glucose tolerance (30-40%), and type 2 diabetes (up to 10%). Over the past several years, chronic decreases in sleep duration and\/or quality have been identified as a risk for the development of a number of metabolic derangements that are strikingly similar to those seen in PCOS. Specifically, decreased sleep quality due to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been causally linked to insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia and hypertension independent of body mass index (BMI). Until recently, however, it had not been recognized that OSA is present in a disproportionate number of women with PCOS: the risk for OSA is at least 5- to 10-fold higher compared to the risk in similarly obese women without PCOS. The causes and consequences of OSA in women with PCOS are addressed in this manuscript.\nResearch is NOT published, but project description is relevant:\nhttp:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3279609\/\n","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"87":{"study_id":"ST000106","study_title":"IWMS Study 1:Weight comparison of obese and lean patients","study_type":"","institute":"University of Michigan","department":"Biomedical Research Core Facilities","last_name":"Kachman","first_name":"Maureen","email":" mkachman@umich.edu","phone":"","submit_date":"2014-09-30","study_summary":"Weight comparision of obese and lean patients.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"88":{"study_id":"ST000107","study_title":"Metabolomic and lipidomic profiles in response to exogenous insulin and GLP-1 infusions during prolonged fasting","study_type":"Timecourse","institute":"University of California, Davis","department":"Nutrition","last_name":"Newman","first_name":"John","email":"john.newman@ars.usda.gov","phone":"+1-530-752-1009","submit_date":"2014-07-10","study_summary":"Seventeen northern elephant seal pups constituting four different cohorts at A\u00f1o Nuevo State Reserve were studied at two post-weaning periods: early (1-2 wk post weaning; n=5) and late (6-7 weeks post weaning; n=12).

Mice were housed individually with free access to water and chow (TD.10112; Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN), with a 12:12-h light-dark cycle and temperature and humidity control. Mice were acclimated for 1 wk prior to the beginning of the experiment. The protocol was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Following a 6-h fast, mice were given intraperitoneal injections of STZ (125 mg\/kg; in sodium acetate buffer, pH = 4.5) (67). Injections were repeated on the following day. Control animals received intraperitoneal injection of vehicle. Only mice that displayed blood glucose ?300 mg\/dl and an increase in blood ketones (both values by Precision Xtra glucometer; Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL), hyperphagia, and polyuria and were positive for urine glucose presence via dipstick (Uristix, Bayer, Pittsburgh, PA) on day 7 after the first STZ dose were included in the experiment. Animals that were positive for STZ diabetes received LinBit subcutaneous insulin implant (LinShin Canada, Toronto, ON, Canada) (79) under pentobarbital sodium anesthesia (Nebutal, 40 mg\/kg of body wt) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Each animal received two subcutaneous implants (total dose: 0.2 U\/24 h for >30 days, 10 U\/kg for 20-g mice). Insulin treatment was continued for 3 wk. Control animals (C; n = 13) received blank implants. Diabetic control was confirmed by biweekly measurements of blood and urinary glucose. In some cases, when urine glucose was present and blood glucose was >288 mg\/dl, the animal received a third implant. The insulin treatment was continued until initially lower plasma glucose content in diabetic animals reached control values. Three weeks following implantation, diabetic mice were divided randomly into diabetic-treated (D + I; n = 13) and diabetic-deprived (D ? I; n = 13) groups. Insulin implants were removed from the D ? I group under pentobarbital anesthesia, which led to the return of the diabetic phenotype within 24 h. Animals from the D + I group continued on insulin treatment (Fig. 1). At the age of 18 wk, animals from all groups were analyzed for body composition by an Echo-MRI Body Composition Analyzer (EchoMRI, Houston, TX) and euthanized by decapitation 5 wk after the initial STZ or vehicle dose. Figure 1 depicts the timeline of the experiment and blood glucose profiles for each experimental group. Additional animals were used for estimation of skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity by acute insulin stimulation. The mice were divided into the C (n = 6), D ? I (n = 7), and D + I (n = 7) groups and followed appropriate experimental treatment, except for acute insulin stimulation 10 min prior to euthanization by pentobarbital overdose.

Prenatal stress of different nature has been demonstrated to affect both the mother and the offspring. Adverse nutritional conditions during gestation can impair the maternal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) and expose the fetus to high levels of glucocorticoids (GC). Evenwhen GC are required for normal brain development; an increased exposure of the fetus to GC as a consequence of prenatal stress can affect fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-gonad axis (HPG) development, impair neurogenesis, and have a long term impact on the offspring\u0092s mental health. Decreased zinc availability can occur during pregnancy as a consequence of different conditions (nutritional deficiency, infections, diabetes, alcohol consumption, and exposure to certain toxicants). Importantly, several of these gestational conditions have been linked to autism. In fact, alterations in maternal zinc homeostasis upon exposure to select environmental stressors (e.g. the phthalate plasticizer bis-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP)) that have become increasingly common since the industrial revolution may underlie the recent rise in the incidence of autism.Alterations in maternal zinc homeostasis could expose the fetus to high GC concentrations secondary to a high maternal GC production and\/or to a decreased capacity of the placenta to metabolize GC to inactive metabolites. The overall goal of this proposal is to investigate if alterations in zinc homeostasis during gestation triggered by either a marginal zinc nutrition or exposure to an environmental pollutant (the phthalate plasticizer bis-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP)) can impair maternal and fetal endocrine signaling leading to impaired fetal brain development.

Here, we have used a Systems Biology approach to determine the association between the taxonomic and metabolomic profile of wounds colonized by bacteria. Pressure ulcer biopsies were harvested from primary chronic wounds and bisected into top and bottom sections prior to analysis of microbiome by pyrosequencing and analysis of metabolome using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Bacterial taxonomy revealed that wounds were colonized predominantly by three main phyla, but differed significantly at the genus level. While taxonomic profiles demonstrated significant variability between wounds, metabolic profiles shared significant similarity based on the depth of the wound biopsy. Association between taxonomy and metabolic landscape indicated significant wound-to-wound similarity in metabolite enrichment sets and metabolic pathway impacts, especially with regard to amino acid metabolism. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a statistically robust correlation between bacterial colonization and metabolic landscape within the chronic wound environment.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"117":{"study_id":"ST000153","study_title":"Primary T Cell Noxa Knockdown (Donor 8)-II","study_type":"","institute":"University of Michigan","department":"Biomedical Research Core Facilities","last_name":"Kachman","first_name":"Maureen","email":" mkachman@umich.edu","phone":"","submit_date":"2015-02-13","study_summary":"Labeling of cells was carried out in triplicate with each sample containing 35e6.

Metabolic optimization requires integration. While glycolysis and glutaminolysis can cooperate to support cellular proliferation, oxidative lactate metabolism opposes glycolysis in oxidative cancer cells engaged in a symbiotic relation with their hypoxic\/glycolytic neighbors. However, little is known concerning the relationship between oxidative lactate metabolism and glutamine metabolism. Using SiHa and HeLa human cancer cells, this study reports that intracellular lactate signaling promotes glutamine uptake and metabolism in oxidative cancer cells. It depends on the uptake of extracellular lactate by monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1). Lactate first stabilizes hypoxia-inducible factor-2\u03b1 (HIF-2\u03b1), and HIF-2\u03b1 then transactivates c-Myc in a pathway that mimics a response to hypoxia. Consequently, lactate-induced c-Myc activation triggers the expression of glutamine transporter ASCT2 and of glutaminase 1 (GLS1), resulting in improved glutamine uptake and catabolism. Elucidation of this metabolic dependence could be of therapeutic interest. First, inhibitors of lactate uptake targeting MCT1 are currently entering clinical trials. They have the potential to indirectly repress glutaminolysis. Second, in oxidative cancer cells, resistance to glutaminolysis inhibition could arise from compensation by oxidative lactate metabolism and increased lactate.\n\nResearch is published, core data not used in publication but project description is relevant:\nhttp:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/15384101.2015.1120930\n","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"124":{"study_id":"ST000160","study_title":"Basic Metabolism Studies (wt and TPA null)","study_type":"","institute":"University of Michigan","department":"Biomedical Research Core Facilities","last_name":"Kachman","first_name":"Maureen","email":" mkachman@umich.edu","phone":"","submit_date":"2014-11-11","study_summary":"compare basic metabolism between wildtype and tPA null mice in brain tissue","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"125":{"study_id":"ST000161","study_title":"Plasma Nucleotide\/adenosine concentrations (Human AxP Batch 3)","study_type":"Exercise and rest","institute":"University of Michigan","department":"Biomedical Research Core Facilities","last_name":"Kachman","first_name":"Maureen","email":" mkachman@umich.edu","phone":"","submit_date":"2014-10-27","study_summary":"This experiment was performed using the following cohorts: 1) healthy controls, 2) patients with scleroderma at low risk for pulmonary hypertension, 3) pateints with scleroderma at high risk for pulmonary hypertension.

Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-citrate lyase, which metabolizes citrate, has been shown to be essential for inflammation, but the ability of exogenous citrate to impact inflammatory signalling cascades remains largely unknown. We hypothesized that citrate would modulate inflammatory responses as both a cellular metabolite and calcium chelator, and tested this hypothesis by determining how clinically relevant levels of citrate modulate monocyte proinflammatory responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in a human acute monocytic leukaemia cell line (THP-1). In normal medium (0\u20224 mM calcium), citrate inhibited LPS-induced tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and interleukin (IL)-8 transcripts, whereas in medium supplemented with calcium (1\u20224 mM), TNF-\u03b1 and IL-8 levels increased and appeared independent of calcium chelation. Using an IL-8\u2013luciferase plasmid construct, the same increased response was observed in the activation of the IL-8 promoter region, suggesting transcriptional regulation. Tricarballylic acid, an inhibitor of ATP-citrate lyase, blocked the ability of citrate to augment TNF-\u03b1, linking citrate's augmentation effect with its metabolism by ATP-citrate lyase. In the presence of citrate, increased histone acetylation was observed in the TNF-\u03b1 and IL-8 promoter regions of THP-1 cells. We observed that citrate can both augment and inhibit proinflammatory cytokine production via modulation of inflammatory gene transactivation. These findings suggest that citrate anti-coagulation may alter immune function through complex interactions with the inflammatory response.\nResearch is published, core data not used but project description is relevant:\nhttp:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/cei.12591\/full\n","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"137":{"study_id":"ST000173","study_title":"Comparative metabolomics study of WT and iButOH tolerant E. coli","study_type":"","institute":"University of Michigan","department":"Biomedical Research Core Facilities","last_name":"Kachman","first_name":"Maureen","email":" mkachman@umich.edu","phone":"","submit_date":"2015-06-04","study_summary":"This study aims to elucidate metabolic mechanisms of tolerance to isobutanol in E. coli.

In the absence of P2X7 or pannexin-1, pyroptosis induced by cytosolic LPS was abrogated. Cleavage of pannexin-1 required the catalytic activity of caspase-11 and was essential for ATP release and P2X7-mediated pyroptosis.

Most preclinical rodent studies are skewed toward the use of male mice to study obesity-induced metabolic dysfunction because of a similar protection observed in female mice. How sex differences in obesity-induced inflammatory responses contribute to these observations is unknown. We have compared and contrasted the effects of high fat diet-induced obesity on glucose metabolism and leukocyte activation in multiple depots in male and female C57Bl\/6 mice. With both short term and long term high fat diet, male mice demonstrated increased weight gain and CD11c(+) adipose tissue macrophage content compared with female mice despite similar degrees of adipocyte hypertrophy. Competitive bone marrow transplant studies demonstrated that obesity induced a preferential contribution of male hematopoietic cells to circulating leukocytes and adipose tissue macrophages compared with female cells independent of the sex of the recipient. Sex differences in macrophage and hematopoietic cell in vitro activation in response to obesogenic cues were observed to explain these results. In summary, this report demonstrates that male and female leukocytes and hematopoietic stem cells have cell-autonomous differences in their response to obesity that contribute to an amplified response in males compared with females.\nThe research is published, but data obtained by core not included in the paper:\nhttp:\/\/www.jbc.org\/cgi\/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=25869128\n","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"144":{"study_id":"ST000183","study_title":"Metabolic analysis of Parp1 ko\/wt Saline & Bleo Mouse Lung Fiboblasts and Human IPF & Normal Lung Fiboblasts (Part 3)","study_type":"Glycolysis\/TCA\/Nucleotide analysis (tissue\/cells)","institute":"University of Michigan","department":"Biomedical Research Core Facilities","last_name":"Kachman","first_name":"Maureen","email":" mkachman@umich.edu","phone":"","submit_date":"2015-06-07","study_summary":"This study is a part of series performed for the same researcher through pilot\/feasibility grant program, so the publication is relevant reference for other studies (ST000143, ST000183)\nThis specific experiment is a small pilot study to establish method performance, it includes four biological replicas of identical cell cultures after the identical treatment and a single tissue sample.\n","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"145":{"study_id":"ST000185","study_title":"Fetal Lambs vascular graft Normal v Shunt LECs","study_type":"Glycolysis\/TCA\/Nucleotide analysis (tissue\/cells)","institute":"University of Michigan","department":"Biomedical Research Core Facilities","last_name":"Kachman","first_name":"Maureen","email":" mkachman@umich.edu","phone":"","submit_date":"2015-06-07","study_summary":"We recently reported superior right ventricle (RV) performance in response to acute afterload challenge in lambs with a model of congenital heart disease with chronic left-to-right cardiac shunts. Compared with control animals, shunt lambs demonstrated increased contractility because of an enhanced Anrep effect (the slow increase in contractility following myocyte stretch). This advantageous physiological response may reflect preservation of a fetal phenotype, since the RV of shunt lambs remains exposed to increased pressure postnatally. Nitric oxide (NO) production by NO synthase (NOS) is activated by myocyte stretch and is a necessary intermediary of the Anrep response. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that NO signaling is increased in the RV of fetal lambs compared with controls and shunt lambs have persistence of this fetal pattern. An 8-mm graft was placed between the pulmonary artery and aorta in fetal lambs (shunt). NOS isoform expression, activity, and association with activating cofactors were determined in fetal tissue obtained during late-gestation and in 4-wk-old juvenile shunt and control lambs.

Although the gut is a vital organ for Zn utilization, and Zn deficiency is associated with impaired intestinal permeability and a global decrease in gastrointestinal health, alterations in the gut microbial ecology of the host under conditions of Zn deficiency have yet to be studied. Using the broiler chicken (Gallus gallus) model, the aim of this study was to characterize distinct cecal microbiota shifts induced by chronic dietary Zn depletion. We demonstrate that Zn deficiency induces significant taxonomic alterations and decreases overall species richness and diversity, establishing a microbial profile resembling that of various other pathological states. Through metagenomic analysis, we show that predicted Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways responsible for macro- and micronutrient uptake are significantly depleted under Zn deficiency; along with concomitant decreases in beneficial short chain fatty acids, such depletions may further preclude optimal host Zn availability. We also identify several candidate microbes that may play a significant role in modulating the bioavailability and utilization of dietary Zn during prolonged deficiency. Our results are the first to characterize a unique and dysbiotic cecal microbiota during Zn deficiency, and provide evidence for such microbial perturbations as potential effectors of the Zn deficient phenotype.\nExperiment setup\nUpon hatching, chicks were randomly allocated into two treatment groups on the basis of body weight and gender (aimed to ensure equal distribution between groups, n = 6): 1.

While antibiotic disruption of the indigenous microbiota underlies the majority of cases of CDI, the early dynamics of infection in the disturbed intestinal ecosystem are poorly characterized. This study defines the dynamics of infection with C. difficile strain VPI 10463 throughout the gastrointestinal (GI) tract using a murine model of infection. After inducing susceptibility to C. difficile colonization via antibiotic administration, we followed the dynamics of spore germination, colonization, sporulation, toxin activity, and disease progression throughout the GI tract. C. difficile spores were able to germinate within 6 h postchallenge, resulting in the establishment of vegetative bacteria in the distal GI tract. Spores and cytotoxin activity were detected by 24 h postchallenge, and histopathologic colitis developed by 30 h. Within 36 h, all infected mice succumbed to infection. We correlated the establishment of infection with changes in the microbiota and bile acid profile of the small and large intestines. Antibiotic administration resulted in significant changes to the microbiota in the small and large intestines, as well as a significant shift in the abundance of primary and secondary bile acids. Ex vivo analysis suggested the small intestine as the site of spore germination. This study provides an integrated understanding of the timing and location of the events surrounding C. difficile colonization and identifies potential targets for the development of new therapeutic strategies.\nResearch is published:\nhttp:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4333439\/\n","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"155":{"study_id":"ST000198","study_title":"Liver and Plasma metaboites for 13C-glucose load in wild type, LIRKO and LIRFKO mice","study_type":"Acyl-carnitine analysis (plasma)","institute":"University of Michigan","department":"Biomedical Research Core Facilities","last_name":"Kachman","first_name":"Maureen","email":" mkachman@umich.edu","phone":"","submit_date":"2015-06-10","study_summary":"FoxO proteins are major targets of insulin action.

We conclude that (1) inhibition of FoxO1 is critical for both direct (hepatic) and indirect effects of insulin on HGP and utilization, and (2) extrahepatic effects of insulin are sufficient to maintain normal whole-body and hepatic glucose metabolism when liver FoxO1 activity is disrupted.\nResearch is published:\nhttp:\/\/www.nature.com\/ncomms\/2015\/150512\/ncomms8079\/full\/ncomms8079.html\n","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"156":{"study_id":"ST000199","study_title":"IDH1 and Glioma knockdown idh1 (part II)","study_type":"","institute":"University of Michigan","department":"Biomedical Research Core Facilities","last_name":"Kachman","first_name":"Maureen","email":" mkachman@umich.edu","phone":"","submit_date":"2015-06-10","study_summary":"Tumor neurospheres were grown in culture until 90% confluent.

Most preclinical rodent studies are skewed toward the use of male mice to study obesity-induced metabolic dysfunction because of a similar protection observed in female mice. How sex differences in obesity-induced inflammatory responses contribute to these observations is unknown. We have compared and contrasted the effects of high fat diet-induced obesity on glucose metabolism and leukocyte activation in multiple depots in male and female C57Bl\/6 mice. With both short term and long term high fat diet, male mice demonstrated increased weight gain and CD11c(+) adipose tissue macrophage content compared with female mice despite similar degrees of adipocyte hypertrophy. Competitive bone marrow transplant studies demonstrated that obesity induced a preferential contribution of male hematopoietic cells to circulating leukocytes and adipose tissue macrophages compared with female cells independent of the sex of the recipient. Sex differences in macrophage and hematopoietic cell in vitro activation in response to obesogenic cues were observed to explain these results. In summary, this report demonstrates that male and female leukocytes and hematopoietic stem cells have cell-autonomous differences in their response to obesity that contribute to an amplified response in males compared with females.\nThe research is published, but data obtained by core not included in the paper:\nhttp:\/\/www.jbc.org\/cgi\/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=25869128\n","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"158":{"study_id":"ST000202","study_title":"THP1 Human Monocyte cells Project A (part II)","study_type":"Glycolysis\/TCA\/Nucleotide analysis (tissue\/cells)","institute":"University of Michigan","department":"Biomedical Research Core Facilities","last_name":"Kachman","first_name":"Maureen","email":" mkachman@umich.edu","phone":"","submit_date":"2015-06-11","study_summary":"Citrate, a central component of cellular metabolism, is a widely used anti-coagulant due to its ability to chelate calcium. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-citrate lyase, which metabolizes citrate, has been shown to be essential for inflammation, but the ability of exogenous citrate to impact inflammatory signalling cascades remains largely unknown. We hypothesized that citrate would modulate inflammatory responses as both a cellular metabolite and calcium chelator, and tested this hypothesis by determining how clinically relevant levels of citrate modulate monocyte proinflammatory responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in a human acute monocytic leukaemia cell line (THP-1). In normal medium (0\u20224 mM calcium), citrate inhibited LPS-induced tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and interleukin (IL)-8 transcripts, whereas in medium supplemented with calcium (1\u20224 mM), TNF-\u03b1 and IL-8 levels increased and appeared independent of calcium chelation. Using an IL-8\u2013luciferase plasmid construct, the same increased response was observed in the activation of the IL-8 promoter region, suggesting transcriptional regulation. Tricarballylic acid, an inhibitor of ATP-citrate lyase, blocked the ability of citrate to augment TNF-\u03b1, linking citrate's augmentation effect with its metabolism by ATP-citrate lyase. In the presence of citrate, increased histone acetylation was observed in the TNF-\u03b1 and IL-8 promoter regions of THP-1 cells. We observed that citrate can both augment and inhibit proinflammatory cytokine production via modulation of inflammatory gene transactivation. These findings suggest that citrate anti-coagulation may alter immune function through complex interactions with the inflammatory response.\nResearch is published, core data not used but project description is relevant:\nhttp:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/cei.12591\/full\n","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"159":{"study_id":"ST000203","study_title":"Germfree vs Conventional Swiss webster mice Studies","study_type":"Short-chain fatty acid analysis","institute":"University of Michigan","department":"Biomedical Research Core Facilities","last_name":"Kachman","first_name":"Maureen","email":" mkachman@umich.edu","phone":"","submit_date":"2015-06-11","study_summary":"The intestinal tract is inhabited by a large and diverse community of microbes collectively referred to as the gut microbiota.

We found that both murine and human alloreactive T cells concomitantly upregulated PD-1 expression and increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. This PD-1HiROSHi phenotype was specific to alloreactive T cells and was not observed in syngeneic T cells during homeostatic proliferation. Blockade of PD-1 signaling decreased both mitochondrial H2O2 and total cellular ROS levels, and PD-1\u2013driven increases in ROS were dependent upon the oxidation of fatty acids, because treatment with etomoxir nullified changes in ROS levels following PD-1 blockade. Downstream of PD-1, elevated ROS levels impaired T cell survival in a process reversed by antioxidants. Furthermore, PD-1\u2013driven changes in ROS were fundamental to establishing a cell\u2019s susceptibility to subsequent metabolic inhibition, because blockade of PD-1 decreased the efficacy of later F1F0-ATP synthase modulation.

Samples were further assessed for the presence and levels of fecal and serum secretory IgA (sIgA), proinflammatory proteins, and fatty acids.\nResults\nThe gut microbiota observed in patients with PsA and patients with skin psoriasis was less diverse when compared to that in healthy controls. This could be attributed to the reduced presence of several taxa. Samples from both patient groups showed a relative decrease in abundance of Coprococcus species, while samples from PsA patients were also characterized by a significant reduction in Akkermansia, Ruminococcus, and Pseudobutyrivibrio. Supernatants of fecal samples from PsA patients revealed an increase in sIgA levels and decrease in RANKL levels. Analysis of fatty acids revealed low fecal quantities of hexanoate and heptanoate in both patients with PsA and patients with psoriasis.\nConclusion\nPatients with PsA and patients with skin psoriasis had a lower relative abundance of multiple intestinal bacteria. Although some genera were concomitantly decreased in both conditions, PsA samples had a lower abundance of reportedly beneficial taxa. This gut microbiota profile in PsA was similar to that previously described in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and was associated with changes in specific inflammatory proteins unique to this group, and distinct from that in patients with skin psoriasis and healthy controls.

For treatment with fatty acids or analogues, the cells were seeded at a density of 2 \u00d7 106 cells in a T25-cm2 flask for 24 h. Each FA or analogue was added to the culture medium as a fatty acid-bovine serum albumin (BSA) complex (2.5:1, FA:BSA) to give the desired final concentration. The controls in these experiments were HepG2 cells with BSA alone. After 24 h treatment, the media was collected, cells were rinsed twice with PBS and cells were harvested for analysis. To each cell suspension prior to lipid extraction a standard mixture of 25 \u00b5g C15:0 PE, C17:0 PC and C71:1 TAG was added as standards.  Extraction of lipids was performed according to the Folch method. For metabolomics analysis, the lipid extracts were resuspended in chloroform\/methanol, 2:1 (v\/v).All analyses were carried out using an Agilent 1200 Series HPLC, ACE 5 C8-300 column (2.1 x 100 mm) and linear gradient elution at a flow rate of 0.1 mL\/min.  Mobile phase A and B consisted of 0.1% formic acid; 10 mM ammonium acetate in H2O and 0.1% formic acid; 10 mM ammonium acetate in ACN\/isopropanol (50\/50; v\/v), respectively.  The injection volume was 4 \u00b5L.  Separation of metabolites was achieved at the following gradient: T=0 min: 30% B; T=1 min: 30% B; T=25 min: 100% B; T=45 min: 100% B; T=47 min: 30% B; and T=60 min: 30% B (re-equilibration).  The HPLC system was directly coupled to a Bruker Soalrix 70 Hybrid FTMS instrument equipped with electrospray ionization source (ESI) (Bruker Daltonics).  The system was controlled by HyStar v.3.4.8.0 software. MS data was collected with resolving power of 78,000 (at m\/z 400) in positive or negative mode under following conditions:  a capillary voltage of (+\/-) 4,500 V and an end plate offset of -500 V. The dry temperature was set at 180\u00b0C. Dry gas flow was maintained 4 L\/min. Acquisition range was 244-1,800 m\/z with 0.2 s ion accumulation time. LC-MS data was converted into mzXML format using CompassXport v. 3.0.6 and processed by mzMine v.2.10 [25] or XCMS data analysis software. Data processing involved mass detection, chromatographic peak detection and deconvolution, isotopic peaks grouping, normalization and peak alignment. Metabolite data were mean-centered and unit-variance scaled to remove the offsets and adjust the importance of high and low abundance metabolites to an equal level. Significantly altered metabolites were defined by a fold change (FC) >2 and p<0.05. Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) of signature metabolites altered in compounds treated cells compared to control were performed in the Metaboanalyst web portal (www.metaboanalyst.ca).","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"188":{"study_id":"ST000242","study_title":"Whole unconditioned medium (Defined culture media, M199),Whole M1 medium,Whole M2 medium","study_type":"differential metabolomics","institute":"Mayo Clinic","department":"Physiology and Biomedical Engineering","last_name":"Farrugia","first_name":"Gianrico","email":"Dasari.Surendra@mayo.edu","phone":"","submit_date":"2015-06-26","study_summary":" Media was flash frozen with N2 and stored at -80 C.

Despite an expanding knowledge of its molecular pathogenesis during the past two decades, robust biomarkers to enable screening, surveillance, and therapy monitoring of CRC are still lacking. In this study, we present a targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-based metabolic profiling approach for identifying biomarker candidates that could enable highly sensitive and specific CRC detection using human serum samples. In this targeted approach, 158 metabolites from 25 metabolic pathways of potential significance were monitored in 234 serum samples from three groups of patients (66 CRC patients, 76 polyp patients, and 92 healthy controls). Partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) models were established, which proved to be powerful for distinguishing CRC patients from both healthy controls and polyp patients. Receiver operating characteristic curves generated based on these PLS-DA models showed high sensitivities (0.96 and 0.89, respectively, for differentiating CRC patients from healthy controls or polyp patients); good specificities (0.80 and 0.88), and excellent areas under the curve (0.93 and 0.95) were also obtained.

In consideration of the challenges involved in identifying metabolite biomarkers in individuals with high risk for colon cancer, we have investigated NMR-based metabolite profiling in combination with numerous demographic parameters to investigate the ability of serum metabolites to differentiate polyp\/CRC patients from healthy subjects.

Because most diapausing insects do not feed, they must live off their body reserves for several months and the proper use of metabolic reserves is critical for surviving diapause and performing after diapause termination. Across multiple insects, metabolic depression during diapause has been associated with a switch from aerobic metabolism to facultative anaerobic metabolism, despite insects not suffering environmental oxygen limitation. While metabolic rates are depressed during diapause overall to save energy, some insects show regular cyclical bouts of higher metabolic activity during diapause. The functional importance of these metabolic cycles and the mechanisms underlying these cycles are still unknown, but they may be critical for properly maintaining the balance between energy states and purge the accumulation of anaerobic metabolic byproducts. In the present study, we will test the hypothesis that periodic cycles of increased metabolism during insect diapause are associated with both regenerating organismal energetic states, particularly ATP that may decline during metabolic depression, and for purging metabolites associated with anaerobic metabolism. We will use a combination of non-targeted uHPLC-MS\/MS metabolomics and targeted NMR-spectroscopy to identify and quantify metabolites that are altered during the cycles in diapausing pupae of the flesh fly, Sarcophaga crassipalpis. This work will allow us to propose specific biochemical and cellular hypotheses for the regulation of cyclic releases from metabolic depression in diapausing insects. Our work may not only reveal the physiological mechanisms regulating metabolic cycles during diapause in flesh fly, but also provide insight to understand the regulation of similar metabolic cycles in mammalian hibernators (i.e., periodic arousal), and also provide insights into how these cycles could be exploited to disrupt the diapause of insect pests.","subject_species":"Sarcophaga crassipalpis"},"239":{"study_id":"ST000295","study_title":"Metabolic analysis of Human and Mouse Lung Fiboblasts","study_type":"","institute":"University of Michigan","department":"Biomedical Research Core Facilities","last_name":"Kachman","first_name":"Maureen","email":"mkachman@med.umich.edu","phone":"(734) 232-8175","submit_date":"2014-10-16","study_summary":"Metabolic analysis of Parp1 ko\/wt Saline & Bleo Mouse Lung Fiboblasts and Human Normal Lung Fiboblasts with TGFbeta and Fizz2 treatment.

Despite tremendous efforts worldwide invested to decipher the genetic components controlling the development of CAD, the genetic architecture of CAD remains largely unclear. As part of an on-going effort to identify molecules and pathways involved in the development of atherosclerotic CAD, we propose to use rigorous angiographic criteria to define CAD phenotype for genomics and metabolomics study. We identified two extreme groups, namely \u201cyoung CAD\u201d group, who are very young individuals (age <= 40 years) proven to have severe CAD required revascularization, and \u201cCAD-free elderly\u201d, who are at very advanced age (Age >= 80 years) but have no angiographically apparent CAD. Phenotypically, these two groups are in sharp contrary. Conventional risk factors account for small portion of different phenotypes. We hypothesize that there are genetically programmed pathways and molecules accelerating atherosclerotic pathogenesis, in the \u201cyoung CAD\u201d patients and preventing the development of CAD in the \u201cCAD-free elderly\u201d patients. We sought to combine genomics and metabolomics approaches to profile and identify these pathways and molecules. Both plasma and urine samples from patients in these two groups, and their age matched control groups, will undergo unbiased metabolomics profiling with high throughput quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS) technology in RTI metabolomics core facility. Comprehensive statistic and multi-variant analytic approaches will be used to identify pathways and molecules significance to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. These data will be integrated with genomics data from next generation sequencing of genetic materials from the same groups of patients to further explore the molecular mechanisms underlying atherosclerosis and CAD.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"251":{"study_id":"ST000307","study_title":"Targeting CRBN to alter CD8 T cell metabolism","study_type":"T cell activation","institute":"University of Florida","department":"SECIM","last_name":"Swearingen","first_name":"Rebecca","email":"rebecca.swearingen@moffitt.org","phone":"-","submit_date":"2015-12-22","study_summary":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the metabolic profile of different treatments of T-Cells among two separate mouse genotypes.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"252":{"study_id":"ST000308","study_title":"13C mass isotopomer analysis (LCMS flux studies) MLL-AF9 (part I)","study_type":"1,2-13C2 Flux analysis","institute":"University of Michigan","department":"Molecular and Human genetics (Baylor College of Medicine)","last_name":"Saitoh","first_name":"Yusuke","email":"Yusuke.Saitoh@bcm.edu","phone":"713-798-1175","submit_date":"2015-06-12","study_summary":"How cancer cells adapt to metabolically adverse conditions in patients and strive to proliferate is a fundamental question in cancer biology. Here we show that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a metabolic checkpoint kinase, confers metabolic stress resistance to leukemia-initiating cells (LICs) and promotes leukemogenesis. Upon dietary restriction, MLL-AF9-induced murine acute myeloid leukemia (AML) activated AMPK and maintained leukemogenic potential. AMPK deletion significantly delayed leukemogenesis and depleted LICs by reducing the expression of glucose transporter 1 (Glut1), compromising glucose flux, and increasing oxidative stress and DNA damage. LICs were particularly dependent on AMPK to suppress oxidative stress in the hypoglycemic bone marrow environment. Strikingly, AMPK inhibition synergized with physiological metabolic stress caused by dietary restriction and profoundly suppressed leukemogenesis. Our results indicate that AMPK protects LICs from metabolic stress and that combining AMPK inhibition with physiological metabolic stress potently suppresses AML by inducing oxidative stress and DNA damage.

Additionally, the antiobesity effects of CLM and fermented-CLM (FCLM) were studied based on the analysis of plasma from high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. The levels of cyanidin and the glycosides of luteolin, quercetin, and cyanidin derived from L. caerulea were decreased, whereas the levels of luteolin and quercetin were increased during fermentation. Isoflavone glycosides and soyasaponins originating from the soybean were decreased, whereas their aglycones such as daidzein, glycitein, and genistein were increased. As for prenylated flavonoids from C. tricuspidata, these metabolites were decreased at the early stage of fermentation, and were increased at end of the fermentation. In terms of the functional food product, various metabolites derived from diverse natural products in CLM had complementary effects and demonstrated higher antioxidant and pancreatic lipase inhibition activities by fermentation; these activities were closely related to flavonoid aglycones including genistein, daidzein, glycitein, luteolin, and quercetin. In vivo experiment, several clinical parameters affected by HFD were remarkably improved by the administration of either CLM or FCLM, but there was a difference in the antiobesity effects. The levels of lysoPCs with C20:4, C16:0, and C22:6 were significantly attenuated by CLM administration, while the attenuated levels of lysoPCs with C20:4 and C18:2 were significantly restored by FCLM administration. These metabolites may explain the above-mentioned differences in antiobesity effects. Although only the changes in plasma lysophospholipids could not fully explain antiobesity effects between non-fermented and fermented plant mixtures from our results, we suggest that metabolomics approach could provide a way to reveal the metabolite alterations in the complex fermentation process and understand the differences or changes in bioactivity according to fermentation.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"261":{"study_id":"ST000317","study_title":"Role of medium in bacterial growth","study_type":"","institute":"University of California, Davis","department":"Genome and Biomedical Sciences Facility","last_name":"Fiehn","first_name":"Oliver","email":"ofiehn@ucdavis.edu","phone":"(530) 754-8258","submit_date":"2014-11-14","study_summary":"Experiment to test how different growth mediums affect bacterial growth.

However, the impact of these alterations on microbial metabolites and by-products and their subsequent impact on disease processes, such as GVHD, are not known. Here we utilized a targetedn unbiased and blinded approach in a blinded fashion to identify novel alterations in the levels of microbial metabolites, specifically levels including the short chain fatty acid (SCFA) and endogenous histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), butyrate, after allo-BMT. Surprisingly, alterations were observed only in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) but not in the luminal contents. The reduced butyrate in IECs (CD326+) after allo-BMT resulted in decreased histone acetylation, which was restored upon local administration of exogenous butyrate. This resulted in improved IEC junctional integrity, increased anti-apoptotic proteins, decreased GVHD, and improved survival. Furthermore, alteration of endogenous microflora with 17 rationally selected strains of high butyrate producing Clostridia, also decreased GVHD and increased survival following allo-BMT in experiments performed at two different institutions. These data demonstrate an heretofore unrecognized role of microbial metabolites and suggests that local and specific alteration of microbial metabolites has direct salutary effects on GVHD target tissues and mitigates its severity.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"281":{"study_id":"ST000339","study_title":"Metabolites in peritoneal macrophages and bone marrow derived macrophages","study_type":"","institute":"University of California, Davis","department":"Genome and Biomedical Sciences Facility","last_name":"Fiehn","first_name":"Oliver","email":"ofiehn@ucdavis.edu","phone":"(530) 754-8258","submit_date":"2015-02-24","study_summary":"Experiment looks to identify metabolites in the major metabolic pathways, i.e. glycolysis, tca, urea cycle and ppp along with amino acids.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"282":{"study_id":"ST000340","study_title":"Metformin effects on liver and kidney tissue","study_type":"","institute":"University of California, Davis","department":"Genome and Biomedical Sciences Facility","last_name":"Fiehn","first_name":"Oliver","email":"ofiehn@ucdavis.edu","phone":"(530) 754-8258","submit_date":"2014-10-14","study_summary":"This experiment aimed to discover the effects of metformin on mouse liver and kidney tissue.

As protein degradation is a major up\u00adregulator of the urea cycle in human rat diabetic models, these findings suggest a broader connection between amylin, diabetes, protein catabolism, and effects on the urea cycle, which may contribute to the increased morbidity and mortality in diabetics at a multi\u00adsystem level beyond the effects on glucose metabolism.","subject_species":"Rattus norvegicus"},"292":{"study_id":"ST000351","study_title":"Determining the metabolic profile of wildtype, lrgAB, and atlA mutant Steptococcus mutans grown aerobically and anaerobically","study_type":"Single time point, aerobic vs. anaerobic cultures","institute":"University of Florida","department":"SECIM","last_name":"Ahn","first_name":"Sang-Joon","email":"sahn@dental.ufl.edu","phone":"352-273-8834","submit_date":"2015-11-16","study_summary":"Whole cells from both aerobic and anaerobic cultures of wild-type,lrgAB and atlA strain will be isolated for analysis of the whole cytosolic metabolome.

Future work will include additional accessions and species of bermudagrass, and testing under field conditions. Bermudagrass accessions identified as tolerant or sensitive by Pang et al. (2011) will be assessed under controlled greenhouse conditions to identify metabolites linked to sting nematode tolerance. Nematode response will be quantified through determination of root length and weight and the number of nematodes present 136 days after inoculation. Higher root length and weight indicate tolerance or resistance. Higher nematode counts indicate greater reproduction (i.e. a susceptible plant), while lower counts indicate that the accession may have some resistance. Metabolites from root tissue of these accessions will be compared to identify those associated with tolerance\/resistance, and those that are associated with nematode infestation by comparing inoculated plants to uninoculated controls. Metabolomic markers will then be developed for the metabolites associated with tolerance\/resistance. These markers will be used to guide future screening of bermudagrass accessions for breeding nematode-tolerant or -resistant varieties.","subject_species":"Cynodon transvaalensis"},"295":{"study_id":"ST000354","study_title":"Metabolite comparison of mouse gastric tissue and glands","study_type":"","institute":"University of California, Davis","department":"Genome and Biomedical Sciences Facility","last_name":"Fiehn","first_name":"Oliver","email":"ofiehn@ucdavis.edu","phone":"(530) 754-8258","submit_date":"2016-02-09","study_summary":"The goal of this project was to compare the metabolite profiles of the: mouse gastric antrum and the mouse gastric corpus, the mouse gastric antrum and the mouse gastric antrum isolated glands, and the mouse gastric corpus and the mouse gastric corpus isolated glands.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"296":{"study_id":"ST000355","study_title":"GC\/MS and LC\/MS metabolomics profiling for breast cancer plasma data and control plasma data","study_type":"metabolomics profiling","institute":"University of Hawaii","department":"Cancer Center","last_name":"Xie","first_name":"Guoxiang","email":"gxie@cc.hawaii.edu","phone":"(808) 564-5938","submit_date":"2016-03-08","study_summary":"Use GC\/MS and LC\/MS technique to profile breast cancer samples and normal control samples","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"297":{"study_id":"ST000356","study_title":"GC\/MS and LC\/MS metabolomics profiling for breast cancer serum data and control serum data","study_type":"metabolomics profiling","institute":"University of Hawaii","department":"Cancer Center","last_name":"Xie","first_name":"Guoxiang","email":"gxie@cc.hawaii.edu","phone":"(808) 564-5938","submit_date":"2016-03-09","study_summary":"Use GC\/MS and LC\/MS technique to profile breast cancer samples and normal control samples","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"298":{"study_id":"ST000357","study_title":"Broad Spectrum MS analysis of mouse hypothalmus from Anxiety Prone HSV-Latently Infected Obese Mice","study_type":"Broad Spectrum LCMS","institute":"University of North Carolina","department":"Discovery Sciences","last_name":"Sumner","first_name":"Susan","email":"susan_sumner\r\n@unc.edu","phone":"704-250-5066","submit_date":"2016-03-03","study_summary":"Brain tissue samples for metabolomics experiments were generated in the following manner: 3-week old mice were placed on a 10% low fat (LF) diet and acclimated for one week prior to intranasal HSV-1 infection or mock infection with PBS.

Understanding the biochemical networks that underlie metabolic homeostasis and how they associate with insulin action will help unravel diabetes etiology and should foster discovery of new biomarkers of disease risk and severity. We examined differences in plasma concentrations of >350 metabolites in fasted obese T2DM vs. obese non-diabetic African-American women, and utilized principal components analysis to identify 158 metabolite components that strongly correlated with fasting HbA1c over a broad range of the latter (r?=??0.631; p<0.0001). In addition to many unidentified small molecules, specific metabolites that were increased significantly in T2DM subjects included certain amino acids and their derivatives (i.e., leucine, 2-ketoisocaproate, valine, cystine, histidine), 2-hydroxybutanoate, long-chain fatty acids, and carbohydrate derivatives. Leucine and valine concentrations rose with increasing HbA1c, and significantly correlated with plasma acetylcarnitine concentrations. It is hypothesized that this reflects a close link between abnormalities in glucose homeostasis, amino acid catabolism, and efficiency of fuel combustion in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. It is speculated that a mechanism for potential TCA cycle inefficiency concurrent with insulin resistance is \u201canaplerotic stress\u201d emanating from reduced amino acid-derived carbon flux to TCA cycle intermediates, which if coupled to perturbation in cataplerosis would lead to net reduction in TCA cycle capacity relative to fuel delivery.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"324":{"study_id":"ST000384","study_title":"Metabolomic profiles in P. gingivalis cells treated with pABA","study_type":"","institute":"Osaka University","department":"Graduate School of Dentistry","last_name":"Kuboniwa","first_name":"Masae","email":"kuboniwa@dent.osaka-u.ac.jp","phone":"+81-6-6879-2922","submit_date":"2016-04-16","study_summary":"Many human infections are polymicrobial in origin, and synergistic interactions among community inhabitants control colonization and pathogenic potential (Murray et al., 2014). However, few interspecies interactions have been functionally dissected at the molecular level or characterized on a systems level. Periodontitis, which is the sixth most prevalent infectious disease worldwide (Kassebaum et al., 2014), is associated with a dysbiotic microbial community, and the keystone pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis forms synergistic communities with the accessory pathogen Streptococcus gordonii (Lamont and Hajishengallis, 2015). P. gingivalis and S. gordonii communicate through co-adhesion and metabolite perception, and close association between P. gingivalis and S. gordonii results in significant changes in the expressed proteomes of both organisms (Kuboniwa et al., 2012, Hendrickson et al., 2012). Here we show that streptococcal 4 aminobenzoate\/para-amino benzoic acid (pABA) is required for maximal accumulation of P. gingivalis in communities with S. gordonii. Exogenous pABA upregulates production of fimbrial interspecies adhesins and of a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent signaling system in P. gingivalis. Consequently, fimbrial-dependent attachment and invasion of epithelial cells by P. gingivalis is also increased by pABA. Moreover, trans-omics studies performed by proteomics and metabolomics showed that pABA induces metabolic shifts within P. gingivalis, predominantly folate derivative biosynthesis. In a murine oral infection model, pABA increased colonization and survival of P. gingivalis, but did not increase virulence. The results establish streptococcal pABA as a major component of the interspecies S. gordonii-P. gingivalis interaction which regulates distinct aspects of polymicrobial synergy.","subject_species":"Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277"},"325":{"study_id":"ST000385","study_title":"Investigation of metabolomic blood biomarkers for detection of adenocarcinoma lung cancer (training set)","study_type":"","institute":"University of California, Davis","department":"Genome and Biomedical Sciences Facility","last_name":"Fiehn","first_name":"Oliver","email":"ofiehn@ucdavis.edu","phone":"(530) 754-8258","submit_date":"2016-10-04","study_summary":"Recently, the National Lung Cancer Screen Trial (NLST) demonstrated that low-dose CT (LDCT) screening could reduce mortality due to lung cancer by 20%.

However, issues including indeterminate nodules detected by LDCT and radiation exposure impact the practicality of LDCT-based screening on a national and global basis. A blood-based biomarker or multiplexed marker panel that could complement LDCT would represent a major advance in implementing lung cancer screening. Efforts to develop blood-based biomarkers for lung cancer early detection using a variety of methodologies are currently ongoing. Proteomic studies have led to the identification of several candidate markers including pro-surfactantproteinB(pro-SFTPB), a target of a lineage-survival oncogene in lung cancer, NKX2-1.Validation studies using blood samples collected at the time of LDCT screening for lung cancer substantiated the performance of pro-SFTPB. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate the predictive ability of pro-SFTPB. The area under the curve (AUC) values of the full model with and without pro-SFTPB were 0.741 (95% CI, 0.696 to 0.783) and 0.669 (95%CI, 0.620 to 0.717), respectively (difference in AUC, P_.001).

This is a critical gap, because major psychiatric disorders show large fluctuations in brain function over this timescale. However, the kind of dense longitudinal phenotyping that is necessary to understand this question is extremely challenging with healthy human volunteers,who are unlikely to be sufficiently motivated to sustain frequent participation in a study over a long period. For this reason, the participation of motivated experimenters can be uniquely useful for demanding longitudinal studies. We investigated the long-range dynamics of brain function andtheir relation to a broad set of psychological and biological variables in a single healthy human (author R.A.P.) over the course of 532 days (along with several follow-up visits), representing one of the most intensive biological characterizations of a single individual ever performed (referred to hereafter as the MyConnectomestudy). The study was designed to measure the broadest possible range of human phenotypes (the phenome\u20193,4) to allow the widespread assessment of relations between psychological, neural and metabolic function. The results of the present study demonstrate that healthy brain function shows rich dynamics over the course of 18 months, and that these dynamics are paralleled by ongoing fluctuations in psychological and physiological function as observed in behaviour,gene expression and metabolomic measurements. These findings provide a proof of concept for the dynamic longitudinal phenotyping of individuals, which we propose will be crucial togain a better understanding of the substantial fluctuations in psychological and neural function in individuals with major psychiatric disorders.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"338":{"study_id":"ST000398","study_title":"Metabolic profiling of maternal urine can aid clinical management of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM)","study_type":"Search for non-treated and treated GDM biomarkers in urine","institute":"University of Aveiro","department":"CICECO-Department of Chemistry","last_name":"Gil","first_name":"Ana","email":"agil@ua.pt","phone":"none","submit_date":"2016-04-20","study_summary":"NMR metabolomics study of maternal urine of 1) GDM women at the time of diagnosis and before treatment, to define the urine metabolic profile of untreated GDM, and of 2) GDM women treated using diet control alone or with the addition of insulin, to identify treatment-resistant and treatment-responsive metabolic pathways and, hence, evaluate treatment efficacy, and 3) GDM treatment prediction at the time of diagnosis, with the aim of finding potential predictive markers of future treatment requirements based on each individual metabotype.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"339":{"study_id":"ST000399","study_title":"E.coli effects on growth and substrate uptake of green algae (part I - HILIC)","study_type":"","institute":"University of California, Davis","department":"Genome and Biomedical Sciences Facility","last_name":"Fiehn","first_name":"Oliver","email":"ofiehn@ucdavis.edu","phone":"(530) 754-8258","submit_date":"2015-04-20","study_summary":"The purpose of this project was to quantify the exchange of thiamine between bacteria and algae.

We sought to distinguish noninvasively the differences in 53 cats before and soon after induction of allergic asthma, using NMR spectra of exhaled breath condensate (EBC). Statistical pattern recognition was improved by preprocessing the spectra with glog transformation. Classification of the 106 preprocessed spectra by principal component analysis, partial least squares with discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and multi-level PLS-DA appears to be impaired by variances unrelated to eosinophilic asthma. By subtracting out confounding variances, orthogonal signal correction (OSC) PLS-DA greatly improved the separation of the healthy and early asthmatic states, attaining 94% specificity and 71% sensitivity in predictions. OSC-PLS-DA results highlight the elevation of acetone in two-thirds of the cats with early asthma. Asthma also decreased at least a dozen compounds, especially carboxylic acids such as short chain fatty acids and amino acids. These trends suggest that a majority of the cats with allergic asthma underwent alteration of metabolic fluxes through pyruvate and acetyl-CoA to promote ketosis.

We need novel therapeutic agents that are affordable, can decrease the reliance on steroids, and can improve quality of life. This clinical and mechanistic study has the potential to impact treatment of a subset of adult severe asthmatics and to further our understanding of the mechanisms of L-arginine metabolism and NO biology in the airways of asthmatics. We will pursue a clinical trial in subjects not well controlled on standard drug therapy; this strategy will address whether L-arginine is efficacious in patients receiving standard of care medications. In studies using animal models, we and others have shown that interventions that augment NO levels, through either supplementation of L-arginine or inhibition of arginase, decrease allergic airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness-the two hallmarks of asthma. Overall, we hypothesize that a responder subset of adult severe asthma patients will derive clinical benefit from supplemental L-arginine therapy and that these patients will have a lower exhaled NO concentrations (<20 ppb) and a higher NOS2\/Arg1 mRNA and protein ratio in their airway epithelial cells than non-responders. We aim to: 1) test the hypothesis that uncontrolled, adult severe asthma patients with exhaled breath NO concentrations <20 ppb will have fewer asthma exacerbations over 3 months when treated with L-arginine compared to patients with FeNO > 25, 2) determine the mechanisms by which L-arginine affects the regulation of NOS and arginase enzymes in primary airway epithelial cell cultures from severe asthmatic subjects, and 3) test the hypothesis that inhaled nanoparticle carrier formulations of L-arginine will decrease airway inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness, and airway fibrosis at lower doses than systemically administered L-arginine. The major impact of our study will be to identify the adult severe asthma cohort that will benefit from supplemental L-arginine therapy. Our ultimate goal is to develop novel therapeutic agents to treat adult severe asthma patients better. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma is a progressive inflammatory airways disease that leads to structural airway changes and debilitating symptoms in many severely affected adults. This clinical study has the potential to improve the care of adult severe asthmatics and to further our understanding of the mechanisms of L-arginine metabolism and nitric oxide biology in the lung. If we demonstrate that L-arginine supplementation can decrease asthma attacks in a subset of severe asthmatics, it will have great implications for future research as well as for the daily lives of patients with asthma.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"358":{"study_id":"ST000421","study_title":"Type 1 Diabetes poor glycemic control versus control samples","study_type":"Plasma metabolites in T1 diabetes","institute":"Mayo Clinic","department":"Endocrinology","last_name":"Nair","first_name":"Sreekumaran","email":"Nair.K@mayo.edu","phone":"507-285-2415","submit_date":"2016-07-15","study_summary":"The objective of the study was to determine whether T1D with good glycemic control have persistent abnormalities of metabolites and pathways that exist in T1D with poor glycemic control.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"359":{"study_id":"ST000422","study_title":"Type 1 Diabetes good glycemic control and controls samples","study_type":"Plasma metabolites in T1 diabetes","institute":"Mayo Clinic","department":"Endocrinology","last_name":"Nair","first_name":"Sreekumaran","email":"Nair.K@mayo.edu","phone":"507-285-2415","submit_date":"2016-07-01","study_summary":"The objective of the study was to determine whether T1D with good glycemic control have persistent abnormalities of metabolites and pathways that exist in T1D with poor glycemic control.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"360":{"study_id":"ST000423","study_title":"Differences in mycoplasma growth due to different mediums","study_type":"","institute":"University of California, Davis","department":"Genome and Biomedical Sciences Facility","last_name":"Fiehn","first_name":"Oliver","email":"ofiehn@ucdavis.edu","phone":"(530) 754-8258","submit_date":"2016-07-08","study_summary":"The object is to learn if there are variations in the lipid profiles of the three genomic variants (relative to one another) and if there are difference the lipid profiles due to growth in medium having different supplements.

Recent data implicate muscle ring finger protein 1 (MuRF1) in lung injury-induced skeletal muscle atrophy in young mice and identify an alternative role for MuRF1 in cardiac metabolism regulation through inhibition of fatty acid oxidation. Objectives: To develop a model of lung injury-induced muscle wasting in old mice and to evaluate the skeletal muscle metabolomic profile of adult and old acute lung injury (ALI) mice. Methods: Young (2 month), adult (6 month) and old (20 month) male C57Bl6J mice underwent Sham (intratracheal H2O) or ALI [intratracheal E. coli lipopolysaccharide (i.t. LPS)] conditions and muscle functional testing. Metabolomic analysis on gastrocnemius muscle was performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Results: Old ALI mice had increased mortality and failed to recover skeletal muscle function compared to adult ALI mice. Muscle MuRF1 expression was increased in old ALI mice at day 3. Non-targeted muscle metabolomics revealed alterations in amino acid biosynthesis and fatty acid metabolism in old ALI mice. Targeted metabolomics of fatty acid intermediates (acyl-carnitines) and amino acids revealed a reduction in long chain acyl-carnitines in old ALI mice. Conclusion: This study demonstrates age-associated susceptibility to ALI-induced muscle wasting which parallels a metabolomic profile suggestive of altered muscle fatty acid metabolism.

Traditional desalting approaches applied to urine pretreatment suffer from the chemical losses, which reduce the information depth of analysis. We aimed to test a simple approach for the simultaneous preconcentration and desalting of organic solutes in urine based on the collection of induced bursting bubble aerosols above the surface of urine samples. Bursting bubbles were generated at ambient conditions by feeding gas through an air diffuser at the bottom of diluted (200 times in ultrapure water) urine solution (50-500 mL). Collected aerosols were analyzed by the direct-infusion electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The simultaneous preconcentration (ca. 6-12 fold) and desalting (ca. 6-10 fold) of organic solutes in urine was achieved by the bursting bubble sample pretreatment, which allowed ca. 3-times higher number of identified urine metabolites by high-resolution MS analysis. No notable chemical discrimination effects were observed. The increased degree of MS data clustering was demonstrated on the principal component analysis of data sets from the urine of healthy people and from the urine people with renal insufficiency. At least 10 times higher sensitivity of trace drug detection in urine was demonstrated for clenbuterol and salbutamol.

The importance of the fecal metabolome has more recently been appreciated, but our knowledge of the microbiome and metabolome at other sites along the gastrointestinal tract remains deficient. Objective: To analyze the gastrointestinal microbiome and metabolome of healthy domestic dogs at four anatomical sites. Methods: Samples of the duodenal, ileal, colonic, and rectal contents were collected from six adult dogs after humane euthanasia for an unrelated study. The microbiota were characterized using Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. The metabolome was characterized by mass spectrometry-based methods. Results: Prevalent phyla throughout the samples were Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, and Bacteroidetes, consistent with previous findings in dogs and other species. A total of 530 unique metabolites were detected; 199 of these were identified as previously named compounds, but 141 of them had at least one significantly different site-pair comparison. Noteworthy examples include amino acids, which decreased from the small to large intestine; pyruvate, which was at peak concentrations in the ileum; and several phenol-containing carboxylic acid compounds that increased in the large intestine. Conclusion: The microbiome and metabolome vary significantly at different sites along the canine gastrointestinal tract.","subject_species":"Canis lupus familiaris"},"426":{"study_id":"ST000496","study_title":"Distinct signatures of dental plaque metabolic byproducts dictated by periodontal inflammatory status","study_type":"","institute":"Osaka University","department":"Graduate School of Dentistry","last_name":"Kuboniwa","first_name":"Masae","email":"kuboniwa@dent.osaka-u.ac.jp","phone":"+81-6-6879-2922","submit_date":"2016-10-23","study_summary":"Onset of chronic periodontitis is associated with an aberrant polymicrobial community, termed dysbiosis. Findings of a recent model of its etiology suggested that dysbiosis holds a conserved metabolic signature as an emergent property. The purpose of this study was to identify robust biomarkers for periodontal inflammation severity. Furthermore, we investigated disease-associated metabolic signatures of periodontal microbiota using a salivary metabolomics approach. Collection of whole saliva samples was performed before and after removal of supragingival plaque (debridement). Periodontal inflamed surface area (PISA) was employed as an indicator of periodontal inflammatory status. Based on multivariate analyses using pre-debridement salivary metabolomics data, we found that the metabolites associated with higher PISA included cadaverine and hydrocinnamate, while uric acid and ethanolamine were associated with lower PISA. Next, we focused on dental plaque metabolic byproducts by selecting significantly decreased salivary metabolites following debridement.

We hypothesized that the identification of the relationships between blood metabolome, transcriptome and miRNome during endurance exercise could provide significant insights into the molecular response to intense exercise or prediction of this response at basal status. In this perspective, the serum metabolome and whole-blood transcriptome and miRNome data were obtained from 10 horses before and after a 160 km endurance competition. Results: We obtained a global regulatory network based on 11 unique metabolites, 263 metabolic genes and 5 miRNAs whose expression was significantly altered at T1 (post- endurance competition) relative to T0 (baseline, pre- endurance competition). This network provided new insights into the cross talk between the distinct molecular pathways (e.g. energy and oxygen sensing, oxidative stress, and inflammation) that were not detectable when analyzing single metabolites or transcripts alone. This suggested that single metabolites and transcripts were carrying out multiple roles and thus sharing several biochemical pathways. Using a regulatory impact factor metric analysis, this regulatory network was further confirmed at the transcription factor and miRNA levels. In an extended cohort of 39 animals, multiple factor analysis confirmed the strong associations between lactate, methylene derivatives, miR-21-5p, miR-16-5p, and genes that coded proteins involved in metabolic reactions primarily related to energy, ubiquitin proteasome and lipopolysaccharide immune responses at T1. Multiple factorial analyses also identified potential biomarkers at T0 for an increased possibility of failure to finish an endurance competition.","subject_species":"Equus caballus"},"432":{"study_id":"ST000504","study_title":"Timecourse of TCA isotopomers in LNCaP Cells and Media","study_type":"","institute":"Mayo Clinic","department":"","last_name":"Frigo","first_name":"Daniel","email":"frigo@uh.edu","phone":"832-842-8824","submit_date":"2016-10-21","study_summary":"Timecourse of TCA isotopomers in LNCaP Cells","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"433":{"study_id":"ST000505","study_title":"Timecourse of Amino Acid Metabolites in LNCaP Cell pellets","study_type":"timecourse","institute":"Mayo Clinic","department":"","last_name":"Frigo","first_name":"Daniel","email":"frigo@uh.edu","phone":"832-842-8824","submit_date":"2016-10-21","study_summary":"Timecourse of Amino Acid Metabolites in LNCaP Cell pellets","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"434":{"study_id":"ST000506","study_title":"Timecourse of TCA panel in LNCaP Cells","study_type":"","institute":"Mayo Clinic","department":"","last_name":"Frigo","first_name":"Daniel","email":"frigo@uh.edu","phone":"832-842-8824","submit_date":"2016-10-21","study_summary":"Timecourse of TCA panel in LNCaP Cells","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"435":{"study_id":"ST000507","study_title":"Timecourse of TCA isotopomers in LNCaP Cells","study_type":"","institute":"Mayo Clinic","department":"","last_name":"Frigo","first_name":"Daniel","email":"frigo@uh.edu","phone":"832-842-8824","submit_date":"2016-10-28","study_summary":"Timecourse of TCA isotopomers in LNCaP Cells","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"436":{"study_id":"ST000508","study_title":"Metabolic Profiling of Date Palm Fruits","study_type":"","institute":"Weill Cornell Medicine, Qatar","department":"Bioinformatics Core","last_name":"Suhre","first_name":"Karsten","email":"nis2034@qatar-med.cornell.edu","phone":"+97433888408","submit_date":"2016-11-14","study_summary":"In this study, two independent large cohorts of mature dates exhibiting substantial diversity in origin, varieties and fruit processing conditions were measured by metabolomics techniques in order to identify major determinants of the fruit metabotype.

Comparison of samples analyzed on both platforms revealed that the high resolution MS has significantly improved sensitivity relative to the triple quadrupole MS at very low-level enrichments due to its ability to resolve interferences in the m\/z dimension.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"463":{"study_id":"ST000546","study_title":"Multi-omics based identification of specific biochemical changes associated with PfKelch13-mutant artemisinin resistant Plasmodium","study_type":"Cell type comparison","institute":"Monash University","department":"Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Drug Delivery, Disposition and Dynamics","last_name":"Creek","first_name":"Darren","email":"Darren.Creek@monash.edu","phone":"N\/A","submit_date":"2017-01-23","study_summary":"Two clonaly artemisinin resistant parasitised red blood cells (trophozoite stage) were compared with artemsinin sensitive parasitised red blood cells by metabolomics analysis.","subject_species":"Plasmodium falciparum"},"464":{"study_id":"ST000547","study_title":"Intergenerational murine gut microbiome variation","study_type":"Intergenerational","institute":"South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute","department":"Infection and Immunity Theme","last_name":"Rogers","first_name":"Geraint","email":"Geraint.rogers@sahmri.com","phone":"N\/A","submit_date":"2016-12-22","study_summary":"Inbred mice are used to investigate many aspects of human physiology, including susceptibility to disease and response to therapies. Despite increasing evidence that the composition and function of the murine intestinal microbiota can substantially influence a broad range of experimental outcomes, relatively little is known about microbiome dynamics within experimental mouse populations. We investigated changes in the intestinal microbiome between C57BL\/6J mice spanning six generations (assessed at generations 1, 2, 3 and 6), following their introduction to a stringently controlled facility. Faecal microbiota composition and function were assessed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, respectively. Significant divergence of the intestinal microbiota between founder and second generation mice, as well as continuing inter-generational variance, was observed. Bacterial taxa whose relative abundance changed significantly included Akkermansia, Turicibacter and Bifidobacterium (p< 0.05), all of which are recognised as having the potential to substantially influence host physiology. Shifts in microbiota composition were mirrored by corresponding differences in the faecal metabolome (r=0.57, p=0.0001), with notable differences in levels of tryptophan pathway metabolites and amino acids, including glutamine, glutamate and aspartate. The magnitude of these changes in the intestinal microbiota and metabolome characteristics during acclimation were on a scale with those observed between populations housed in separate facilities, which differed in regards to husbandry, barrier conditions and dietary intake. The microbiome variance reported here has major implications for experimental reproducibility, and as a consequence, experimental design and the interpretation of research outcomes across as wide range of contexts.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"465":{"study_id":"ST000548","study_title":"Replication study: The common feature of leukemia-associated IDH1 and IDH2 mutations is a neomorphic enzyme activity converting alpha-ketoglutarate to 2-hydroxyglutarate","study_type":"","institute":"University of California, Davis","department":"Genome and Biomedical Sciences Facility","last_name":"Fiehn","first_name":"Oliver","email":"ofiehn@ucdavis.edu","phone":"(530) 754-8258","submit_date":"2017-01-06","study_summary":"The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology seeks to address growing concerns about reproducibility in scientific research by conducting replications of selected experiments from a number of high-profile papers in the field of cancer biology.

IgAN is a major cause of end-stage renal disease with its associated cardio-renal morbidity and mortality. Analyses of the IgA deposits revealed that the IgA is exclusively of the IgA1 subclass and that this IgA1 is aberrantly glycosylated, deficient in galactose in some O-glycans (Gd-IgA1). Patients with IgAN have elevated serum levels of Gd-IgA1 bound by anti-glycan autoantibodies in circulating immune complexes (CIC) that are fundamental in driving disease pathology in an autoimmune process. We have recently shown that elevated serum levels of Gd-IgA1 in patients with IgAN predict disease progression. Thus, understanding the mechanisms behind Gd-IgA1 production will improve future treatment options, as there is presently no disease-specific therapy. A total of 24 cell pellets (4 replicates from 6 cell lines) were analyzed by LCMS metabolomics. Immortalized immunoglobulin-producing cell lines were generated from peripheral-blood lymphocytes from patients with IgAN and healthy controls as described in Suzuki, H., Moldoveanu, Z., Hall, S., et al.

To find the patients with fetal growth restriction (FGR), we reviewed de-identified questionnaires and de-identified previously collected data, and performed a growth potential formula considering gestational age, infant gender, maternal and paternal height, and interaction of gestational age with maternal weight. Using a case:control ratio of 1:2, matched on study site, maternal age (\u00b1 2 years), parity, and infant's sex, 53 cases were matched to 106 controls for a total of 159 patients, and 318 samples (one in each ttrimester). The samples were analyses by NMR spectroscopy, using Bruker IVDr platform. Identification of FGR cases and controls: FGR cases were determined using the AUDIPOG formula for the average predicted birthweight for an infant with specific characteristics of: maternal height, age, and prenatal weight, as well as infant sex, gestational age, and birth rank.

Exclusion criteria were: use of antimalarials in the previous 30 days, refusal to be followed up for 42 days and any clinical complication. Patients received supervised treatment with 25 mg\/kg of chloroquine (CQ) phosphate over a 3-day period (10 mg\/kg on day 0 and 7.5 mg\/kg on days 1 and 2). Primaquine (0.5 mg\/kg per day for 7 days) was prescribed at the end of the 42-day follow-up period. Patients who vomited the first dose within 30 minutes after drug ingestion were re-treated with the same dose. Patients were evaluated on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 28 and 42 and, if they felt ill, at any time during the study period. Blood smear readings, complete blood counts, and diagnostic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifications were performed at all time points. Three aliquots of 100 \u00b5L of whole blood from the day of a recurrence were spotted onto filter paper for later analysis by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to estimate the levels of CQ and desethylchloroquine (DCQ) as previously described. In this study, CQ-resistance with parasitological failure was defined as parasite recurrence in the presence of plasma concentrations of CQ and DSQ higher than 100 ng\/mL and microsatellite analysis revealing the presence of the same clonal nature at diagnosis and recurrence. The CQ-sensitive control group consisted of patients with no parasitemia recurring during follow-up period. A group of 20 healthy individuals from Brazil was used as non-malarial control group. Within the MaHPIC, this project is known as \u2018Experiment HuA\u2019.

We observed in the previous mice feeding study that levels of PGD2 increased in HFD fed mice and stayed high after the diet switch. Other members of the Prostaglandin family followed a similar trend (15-deoxy PGJ2, PGJ2) and were specific to adipose tissue. Based on previously published data indicating that central injection of PGD2 stimulates food intake, we attempted to observe this effect using an oral PGD2 inhibitor of H-PGDS (HQL-79). In fact, the oral inhibitor of the H-PGDS (HQL-79) administered peripherally (oral gavage in mice at 30mg\/kg dose) reduced daily food intake. Mice were divided into two groups termed Vehicle (Control) and HGL-79 (H-PGDS inhibitor). Each group was analyzed for lipid mediator changes (including PGD2) in adipose tissue by the Newman lab. Analytical results generally met quality control criterion with respect to surrogate recoveries and replicate precision. Surrogate recoveries were good for most oxylipins (58-76%), endocannabinoids (53-75%), and fatty acids (36%). Recovery precision was good for most analytes in these profiles, ranging from 6-28% RSD for most surrogates. The precision for the LTB4 surrogate was higher than most others (38%). Analytical precision was assessed by duplicate analysis of two separate study samples. Analytical precision was 62 - 69% of analytes having <30% RSD for all profiles and correlation analysis for the analytes within these samples ranged from 0.90-0.99 R2. The complete data set is in the associated excel file (Osborn HQL-79 \u2013 Deliverable Data Newman Lab.xls). There were few statistically significant differences observed when comparing concentrations (pmol\/gr) between the control and HGL-79 treatment groups. However, when we compared ratios we saw numerous differences between PGD2 and its metabolite d15-PGJ2 versus other prostaglandins. Specifically, ratios between PGD2 and other connected pathway metabolites indicate a shift toward PGE2 and PGF2a production instead of PGD2 (Figure 1) with HQL-79 treatment. The PGD2 and PGE2 metabolites ratio of d15-PGJ2\/15-keto PGE2 was statistically significant (P<0.01) using a two-tailed t-test. The ratios of PGD2\/PGE2 and PGD2\/PGF2 had p values of P<0.09 and P=0.07), respectively. Considering that we were predicting changes that indicated less PGD2 production it may be justifiable to use one-tailed tests instead. In order to maintain consistency with the metabolomic data analysis in the previous study, I followed the same statistical protocol that Johannes preformed for the main Pilot study. Using R and Devium log transformed data. Since this was a two group comparision, if the data was normal a 2 tailed t-test was used and if not normal then Mann-Whitney was used. A far as the significance of a shift from PGD2 to PGE2 production, I found a nice review article that discusses in detail the role of prostaglandins in white adipose tissue (Flachs et al. 2013). In the review it cites articles that have shown PGE2 to induce UCP1, modulate lipolysis adipogenesis, and stimulate leptin release. On the other hand, PGD2 was shown to increase adipogenesis and weight gain. Its downstream product d15-PGJ2 has been shown to increase adipogenesis, adipocyte differentiation, and decrease leptin production. This is significant since I also observed that the ratio of d15-PGJ2 to 15-keto PGE2 (the downstream product of PGE2) was also decreased. Another prostaglandin whose ratio versus PGD2 was different in the inhibitor group was PGF2a which has been shown to increase glucose transport in adipose tissue.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"509":{"study_id":"ST000594","study_title":"PGD2 and other lipid mediator changes in mouse adipose associated with administration of an oral inhibitor of H-PGDS (HQL-79) (part II)","study_type":"","institute":"University of California, Davis","department":"USDA Western Human Nutrition Research Center","last_name":"Newman","first_name":"John","email":"john.newman@ars.usda.gov","phone":"+1-530-752-1009","submit_date":"2017-04-13","study_summary":"This is an additional experiment being added onto a previous mouse feeding study that aimed to identify changes in metabolites that occur in metabolic tissues in the obese state that are long-lasting and not reversed by weight loss.

In studies using animal models, we and others have shown that interventions that augment NO levels, through either supplementation of L-arginine or inhibition of arginase, decrease allergic airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness-the two hallmarks of asthma. Overall, we hypothesize that a responder subset of adult severe asthma patients will derive clinical benefit from supplemental L-arginine therapy and that these patients will have a lower exhaled NO concentrations (<20 ppb) and a higher NOS2\/Arg1 mRNA and protein ratio in their airway epithelial cells than non-responders. We aim to: 1) test the hypothesis that uncontrolled, adult severe asthma patients with exhaled breath NO concentrations <20 ppb will have fewer asthma exacerbations over 3 months when treated with L-arginine compared to patients with FeNO > 25, 2) determine the mechanisms by which L-arginine affects the regulation of NOS and arginase enzymes in primary airway epithelial cell cultures from severe asthmatic subjects, and 3) test the hypothesis that inhaled nanoparticle carrier formulations of L-arginine will decrease airway inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness, and airway fibrosis at lower doses than systemically administered L-arginine. The major impact of our study will be to identify the adult severe asthma cohort that will benefit from supplemental L-arginine therapy. Our ultimate goal is to develop novel therapeutic agents to treat adult severe asthma patients better. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma is a progressive inflammatory airways disease that leads to structural airway changes and debilitating symptoms in many severely affected adults. This clinical study has the potential to improve the care of adult severe asthmatics and to further our understanding of the mechanisms of L-arginine metabolism and nitric oxide biology in the lung. If we demonstrate that L-arginine supplementation can decrease asthma attacks in a subset of severe asthmatics, it will have great implications for future research as well as for the daily lives of patients with asthma.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"518":{"study_id":"ST000605","study_title":"Whole blood reveals more metabolic detail of the human metabolome than serum as measured by 1H-NMR spectroscopy: Implications for sepsis metabolomics","study_type":"Single timepoint; healthy controls","institute":"University of Michigan","department":"Clinical Pharmacy","last_name":"Stringer","first_name":"Kathleen","email":"NMRmetabolomics@umich.edu","phone":"NA","submit_date":"2016-12-08","study_summary":"Healthy volunteers","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"519":{"study_id":"ST000606","study_title":"Bioprospection of the aromatic potential of species from the Atlantic Rainforest in S\u00e3o Paulo: occurrence, taxonomy and chemical, genetic and physiological characterization of plant populations","study_type":"Chemcial profile of the volatiles from plants of the Atlantic Rainforest in S\u00e3o Paulo","institute":"Instituto Agron\u00f4mico, IAC, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil","department":"Centro de Pesquisa e Desenvolvimento de Recursos Gen\u00e9ticos Vegetais","last_name":"Ortiz Mayo Marques","first_name":"Marcia","email":"mortiz@iac.sp.gov.br","phone":"+55(19) 3202-1770","submit_date":"2017-05-14","study_summary":"Native plants were sampled from nine Atlantic rainforest locations in Brazil for botanical identification, herbarium mounts and chemical analyses.

Here we analyzed the stability of polar metabolites and lipids in DBS samples collected in 2000-2001 and stored at room temperature. The identified and statistically significant molecules were then compared to matched serum samples stored at \u201380\u00b0C to determine if the DBS samples could be effectively used in a longitudinal study following metabolic disease. A total of 400 polar metabolites and lipids were identified in the serum and DBS samples using gas chromatograph\/mass spectrometry (GC\/MS), liquid chromatography (LC)\/MS, and LC\/ion mobility spectrometry-MS (LC\/IMS-MS). The identified polar metabolites overlapped well between the sample types, though only one statistically significant metabolite was conserved in a case-control study of older diabetic males with low amounts of high-density lipoproteins and high body mass indices, triacylglycerides and glucose levels when compared to non-diabetic patients with normal levels, indicating that degradation in the DBS samples affects polar metabolite quantitation. Differences in the lipid identifications indicated that some oxidation occurs in the DBS samples. However, 36 statistically significant lipids correlated in both sample types. The difference in the number of statistically significant polar metabolites and lipids indicated that the lipids did not degrade to as great of a degree as the polar metabolites in the DBS samples and lipid quantitation was still possible.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"522":{"study_id":"ST000611","study_title":"Relative level of inosine\/adenosine and sarcosine","study_type":"","institute":"Baylor College of Medicine","department":"","last_name":"Sreekumar","first_name":"Arun","email":"Arun.Sreekumar@bcm.edu","phone":"713-798-3305","submit_date":"2017-05-19","study_summary":"LC\/MS-MS measurement of inosine to adenosine ratio as well as GC\/MS measurement of sarcosine relative values in urine samples from prostate cancer and case control patients in a group of ancestry verified African American and European American.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"523":{"study_id":"ST000612","study_title":"Sphingolipid Analysis of Human Aqueous Humor in Glaucomatous and Control eyes (part I)","study_type":"","institute":"University of Miami","department":"","last_name":"Bhattacharya","first_name":"Sanjoy","email":"sbhattacharya@med.miami.edu","phone":"3054824103","submit_date":"2017-05-26","study_summary":"This study examined the profiles of sphin\u00acgolipids and ceramides present in the aqueous humor (AH) of human control and POAG donors.

However, several limitations must be overcome before algae-based production is economically feasible. Among these is the ability to induce lipid accumulation and storage without affecting biomass yield. To overcome this barrier, a chemical genetics approach was employed in which 43,783 compounds were screened against Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and 243 compounds were identified that increase triacylglyceride (TAG) accumulation without terminating growth. Identified compounds were classified by structural similarity and 15 selected for secondary analyses addressing impacts on growth fitness, photosynthetic pigments, and total cellular protein and starch concentrations. TAG accumulation was verified using GC-MS quantification of total fatty acids and targeted TAG and galactolipid (GL) measurements using LC-MRM\/MS. These results demonstrated TAG accumulation does not necessarily proceed at the expense of GL. Untargeted metabolite profiling provided important insights into pathway shifts due to 5 different compound treatments and verified the anabolic state of the cells with regard to the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, Calvin cycle, tricarboxylic acid cycle and amino acid biosynthetic pathways. Metabolite patterns were distinct from nitrogen starvation and other abiotic stresses commonly used to induce oil accumulation in algae. The efficacy of these compounds was also demonstrated in 3 other algal species. These lipid inducing compounds offer a valuable set of tools for delving into the biochemical mechanisms of lipid accumulation in algae and a direct means to improve algal oil content independent of the severe growth limitations associated with nutrient deprivation.","subject_species":"Chlamydomonas reinhardtii"},"534":{"study_id":"ST000623","study_title":"Non-targeted Metabolomics Analysis of Golden Retriever Muscular Dystrophy-Affected Muscles Reveals Alterations in Arginine and Proline Metabolism, and Elevations in Glutamic and Oleic Acid In Vivo","study_type":"","institute":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","department":"McAllister heart Institute, Department of Internal medicine, Department of Pathology & Laboratory, Department of Pharmacology","last_name":"Willis","first_name":"Monte","email":"monte_willis@med.unc.edu","phone":"(984) 999-5431","submit_date":"2017-04-27","study_summary":"Like Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the Golden Retriever Muscular Dystrophy (GRMD) dog model of DMD exhibits is characterized by muscle necrosis, progressive paralysis, and pseudohypertrophy in specific skeletal muscles. This severe GRMD phenotype included atrophy of the biceps femoris (BF) and compared to unaffected normal dogs, while the long digital extensor (LDE) of the pelvic limb, serving as a hip flex and stifle extensor, is unaffected. A recent microarray analysis of GRMD identified alterations in genes associated with lipid metabolism and energy production. We, therefore, undertook a non-targeted metabolomics analysis of the GRMD BF (affected) and LDE (unaffected) using GC-MS to identify underlying metabolic defects specific for affected GRMD skeletal muscle. Of the 134 metabolites identified in BF, eight were significantly altered in GRMD BF compared to control BF (Glutamic Acid (2.48 fold vs. controls); Oleic Acid (1.76 fold vs. controls); Proline (1.73 fold vs. controls); Myoinositol-2- Phosphate (0.44 fold vs. controls); Fumaric Acid (0.40 fold vs. controls); Carnosine (0.40 fold vs. controls); Lactamide (0.33 fold vs. controls); and Stearamide (0.23 fold vs. controls). Pathway analysis of the T-test significant metabolites identified BF muscle metabolites significantly enriched for Arginine and proline metabolism (p=5.8E-4, FDR=0.04) and Alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism (p=1.3E-3, FDR=0.05). The GRMD LDE previously reported to be unaffected, in contrast, had only one significantly altered metabolite (3-Phosphoglyceric Acid (0.35 Fold vs. controls)).The identification of elevated BF Oleic acid (a long-chain fatty acid) is consistent with recent microarray studies identifying altered lipid metabolism genes, while alterations in Arginine and Proline metabolism are consistent with recent studies identifying elevated L-arginine in DMD patient sera as a biomarker of disease (alterations in DMD or GRMD muscle itself have not previously been reported).Together, these studies demonstrate muscle-specific alterations in GRMD-affected muscle, which illustrate previously unidentified metabolic changes.","subject_species":"Canis lupus familiaris"},"535":{"study_id":"ST000624","study_title":"Human trabecular meshowrk phospholipid profiles of control and glaucomatous eyes","study_type":"","institute":"University of Miami","department":"","last_name":"Bhattacharya","first_name":"Sanjoy","email":"SBhattacharya@med.miami.edu","phone":"305-482-4103","submit_date":"2017-06-01","study_summary":"We compared phospholipid (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylinositol) profiles of control and glaucomatous trabecular meshwork (TM) derived from human donors.Lipid extraction was performed using a modification of the Bligh and Dyer method, protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method, and for select samples confirmed with densitometry of PHAST gels.

Use gas chromatography\/mass spectrometry (GC\/MS) analysis, and liquid chromatography\/mass spectrometry (LC\/MS)analysis to find the differences of metabolic profiles between the high sodium level and the low sodium level, and compare the metabolic profiles of A with the metabolic profiles of B at the low and high sodium level.

This work builds on our previous study showing that soybean oil, rich in polyunsaturated fats, is more obesogenic and diabetogenic than coconut oil, rich in saturated fats (PMID: 26200659). Here, in order to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for soybean oil induced obesity, we have performed the first ever metabolomics (in plasma and liver) and proteomics on the livers of mice fed the two soybean oil diets (plus those fed a high coconut oil and Viv chow diet).

Here, working in mouse models of inflammation, we found that mTOR-dependent metabolic adaptation was required at discrete locations. mTOR was dispensable for DC homeostasis in secondary lymphoid tissues, but necessary to regulate cellular metabolism and accumulation of CD103+ DCs and alveolar macrophages in lung. Moreover, whilst numbers of mTOR-deficient lung CD11b+ DCs were not changed, they were metabolically reprogrammed to skew allergic inflammation from eosinophilic Th2 to neutrophilic Th17 polarity. The mechanism for this change was independent of translational control, but dependent on inflammatory DC which produced IL-23 and increased fatty acid oxidation. mTOR therefore mediates metabolic adaptation of APCs in distinct tissues, influencing the immunological character of allergic inflammation.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"569":{"study_id":"ST000658","study_title":"Omega-6 and omega-3 oxylipins are implicated in soybean oil-induced obesity in mice (part IV)","study_type":"","institute":"University of California, Davis","department":"Genome and Biomedical Sciences Facility","last_name":"Fiehn","first_name":"Oliver","email":"ofiehn@ucdavis.edu","phone":"(530) 754-8258","submit_date":"2017-06-23","study_summary":"In this study we have compared the metabolic effects of conventional soybean oil to those of genetically modified Plenish soybean oil, that is low in linoleic acid and high in oleic acid.

The mainstay of treatment to improve lower limb symptoms is supervised walking therapy, which does not affect plaque morphology or alter conduit artery blood flow, but rather ameliorates endothelial dysfunction, enhances skeletal muscle metabolism and mitochondrial function, and suppresses inflammatory activation. In this pilot feasibility project we will employ metabolic and lipidomic techniques to measure the effects of supervised exercise therapy on primary metabolism, complex lipids, and lipid mediators, and correlate these effects with individual, subject-level measures of the response to exercise therapy among subjects with PAD. The overarching theme of this work is to identify metabolites, complex lipids, and lipid mediators that are associated with the inter-individual variability in the response of subjects with PAD to supervised exercise therapy. This knowledge will significantly enhance our understanding of the pathophysiology of lower extremity symptoms in PAD, as well as the manner in which supervised exercise therapy improves walking intolerance. It will identify novel therapeutic targets and pathways for pharmacologic manipulation in the treatment of PAD. Aside from having the potential to generate multiple high-impact publications, it will serve as the basis for a planned NIH R01 submission by the PI at the conclusion of the award period.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"571":{"study_id":"ST000660","study_title":"Omega-6 and omega-3 oxylipins are implicated in soybean oil-induced obesity in mice (part I)","study_type":"","institute":"University of California, Davis","department":"Genome and Biomedical Sciences Facility","last_name":"Fiehn","first_name":"Oliver","email":"ofiehn@ucdavis.edu","phone":"(530) 754-8258","submit_date":"2017-06-22","study_summary":"In this study we have compared the metabolic effects of conventional soybean oil to those of genetically modified Plenish soybean oil, that is low in linoleic acid and high in oleic acid.

Preliminary data: We have conducted whole blood cell microarray comparing gene expression profile of 20 SPMS and 13 BMS patients. The data revealed significant increase in pathways involving iron ion binding, oxygen transporter activity and hemoglobin functions. Specifically, the identified down regulated genes are involved in interacting selectively and non-covalently with iron (Fe) ions. Heme has been described as a potent pro-inflammatory molecule that can induce multiple innate immune responses, and cause excessive iron and heme-induced oxidative stress and cell death. In the brain, it causes neurodegeneration. In addition, our microarray preliminary results also show a statistically significant increase in arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase activity in SPMS compared to benign MS. Specific aim. To validate metabolites and lipid biomarkers in serum samples from patients with benign and secondary progressive MS. Our central hypothesis is that the gene expression in various types of multiple sclerosis likely create a systematic metabolomic\/lipidomic environment that leads to progression in MS. We plan to compare and contrast metabolomics in SP-MS to BMS patients using the innovative technology at the Metabolomics Research Core at the University of Michigan. By monitoring lipid and metabolite changes in SP and BMS patients, we aim to identify molecular processes and biomarkers of axonal damage for MS. Then, we plan to translate such metabolomic biomarkers to correlate with our rich clinical, immunological and imaging readouts. The goal of this project is to develop a blood-based test to differentiate SP-MS from BMS patients. To accomplish this, we will first identify the gene expression signature associated with of SP-MS. Then, we will correlate these gene expression changes with lipids and metabolite changes in the blood by metabolomic network analysis. Because metabolism is the final fingerprint of functionality and has been implicated in neurodegeneration, metabolomic network analysis can be used for refining the relationships between specific gene expression and metabolites and axonal damage in progressive MS. Ultimately, we hope to develop blood, CSF and stool-based assays, and use this comprehensive profile to predict susceptibility and progression of MS. This is a new and innovative idea, which will hope to lead to future diagnostic and therapeutic development in MS.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"600":{"study_id":"ST000689","study_title":"Influence of Noxa knockdown on cell metabolism","study_type":"MS analysis","institute":"University of Michigan","department":"Biomedical Research Core Facilities","last_name":"Kachman","first_name":"Maureen","email":"mkachman@med.umich.edu","phone":"(734) 232-8175","submit_date":"2017-06-19","study_summary":"Stable clones of Control lentiviral (CLV) or lentiviral Noxa knockdown cells (NshLV7) (as described in Lowman et al, 2010) were counted at T-18hr and 60E6 cells were resuspended in 100ml of fresh complete medium.

We study the ecology, evolution, behavior, and physiology of wild North American red squirrels where we are able to follow individual squirrels across their lifetime from birth until death. We are beginning to document aging in this natural population and are interested in understanding whether there is a signature of aging using metabolomics. We collected plasma samples from the oldest female and male squirrels in our study population and also from an equivalent number of younger squirrels. We will use an untargeted approach to provide an assessment of what metabolites differ among very old and young squirrels. The aim of these analyses is to allow us to identify if the same metabolites that have been identified as biomarkers of advanced age from laboratory mice are also biomarkers of advanced age in red squirrels. After we complete these untargeted analyses, we aim to develop a metabolomics panel for this species so that we can use a more targeted approach to assess how the metabolic profiles of specific pathways (glucose\/fatty acid metabolism, redox homeostasis) change with age in offspring exposed to increased perinatal stress in our study species.","subject_species":"Tamiasciurus hudsonicus"},"632":{"study_id":"ST000725","study_title":"Metabolome, body composition, and muscle performance in children","study_type":"MS analysis","institute":"University of Michigan","department":"Biomedical Research Core Facilities","last_name":"Kachman","first_name":"Maureen","email":"mkachman@med.umich.edu","phone":"(734) 232-8175","submit_date":"2017-06-19","study_summary":"The purpose of this study is to determine potential relationships between plasma metabolome patterns and body composition in addition to muscle quality and muscular performance in children.

It is known that the fate of the diverse NPC populations is determined by the interplay of transcription factors and regulation by regional humoral cues. However, despite our recent appreciation that nutrient-regulated intracellular metabolic milieu (pO2, energy, and redox state) significantly influence cell fate, an unexplored area is whether NPCs have intrinsic metabolic identity, and if so, the mechanism by which molecular metabolism contributes to brain development.Little is known however, if intrinsic differences in cellular metabolism of regional NPCs make certain NPCs susceptible while others resistant to genetic and environmental insults.

However, the majority of metabolites that most accurately distinguished patient samples at time of diagnosis from those at one month after the start of therapy lacked structural identification. The detection of unknown metabolite structures is a well-known limitation of untargeted metabolomics, and underscores a need for continued elucidation of novel metabolite structures. In this study, we sought to define the structure of a urine metabolite with an experimentally determined mass of 202.1326 Da, classified as molecular feature (MF) 202.1326. A hypothesized structure of N1-acetylisoputreanine was developed for MF 202.1326 using in silico tools and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS\/MS). In the absence of a commercial standard, synthetic N1-acetylisoputreanine was generated using enzymatic and chemical synthesis and LC-MS\/MS was used to confirm the structure of MF 202.1326 as N1-acetylisoputreanine, a proposed terminal polyamine catabolite that had not been previously detected in biological samples. Further analysis demonstrated that N1-acetylisoputreanine and an alternative form of this metabolite, N1-acetylisoputreanine-\u03b3-lactam, are both present in human urine and are likely end-products of polyamine metabolism.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"685":{"study_id":"ST000787","study_title":"Identifying metabolic adaptations characteristic of multiple myeloma cells via mass spectrometry-based metabolite profiling from Peripheral Plasma","study_type":"","institute":"Mayo Clinic","department":"","last_name":"Gonsalves","first_name":"Wilson","email":"gonsalves.wilson@mayo.edu","phone":"507-266-0792","submit_date":"2017-07-11","study_summary":"Will be assessing the untargeted metabolomic profiles of high risk versus low risk smoldering myeloma patients based on peripheral blood plasma, bone marrow plasma and Cd138+ plasma cells.

In this study, we used plasma samples collected from patients recruited at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital to investigate metabolites that may be associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a race-specific manner. Methods: Plasma samples were protein depleted using a solution composed of acetonitrile:isopropanol:water (3:3:2) containing a mixture of isotope-labeled internal standards. The extracted metabolites were trimethylsilyl derivatized prior to analysis by GC-MS. A quality control (QC) sample derived by pooling plasma from multiple subjects was run in between samples to assess reproducibility. A mixture of fatty acids methyl esters (FAMEs) and alkane standards was run for retention index calibration. The mixture of isotope-labeled internal standards was used to evaluate the reproducibility of the GC-MS data across multiple runs. Preliminary Data: Plasma samples collected from 40 HCC cases and 44 patients with liver cirrhosis were analyzed. The cirrhotic controls were frequency matched with the HCC cases by demographic variables. The participants included 19 African Americans (AA) and 50 European Americans (EA). The analysis targeted 46 metabolites for quantitative analysis by Agilent GC-qMS in selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode. The data were pre-processed by the Automated Mass Spectral Deconvolution and Identification System (AMDIS) for peak detection, deconvolution, and identification. The resulting peaks were aligned using Mass Profiler Professional (MPP) from Agilent Technologies. A LASSO regression model was applied to select metabolites with significant changes in HCC vs. cirrhosis in three groups: (1) AA and EA combined; (2) AA only; and (3) EA only. Also, metabolites that distinguish HCC cases from cirrhosis in the three groups were selected by considering only those subjects with Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The performances of the metabolites selected by LASSO in each group were evaluated through a leave-one-out cross-validation. We identified race-specific metabolites that differentiated HCC cases from cirrhotic controls, yielding better area under the ROC curve compared to alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) - the serological marker widely used for the diagnosis of HCC. Novel Aspect: We identified race-associated metabolites that are significantly altered in HCC vs. cirrhosis, suggesting the potential role of race in HCC.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"753":{"study_id":"ST000866","study_title":"Large Untargeted Profiling in PAR1 and PAR2 Mice after SCI","study_type":"","institute":"Mayo Clinic","department":"","last_name":"Scarisbrick","first_name":"Isobel","email":"scarisbrick.isobel@mayo.edu","phone":"507-284-0124","submit_date":"2017-08-11","study_summary":"Large Untargeted Profiling in NEFA in PAR1 and PAR2 Mice after SCI.

The aim of this work is to evaluate the intraspecies differences between marine and terrestrial actinomycetes on metabolic level and to uncover the mechanism responsible for the differences. To address this, we carried out comparative metabolomics study on Nesterenkonia flava strains isolated from marine and terrestrial environments. The results showed that marine strains were clearly distinguished from their terrestrial congeners on the principal components analysis (PCA) scores plot of intracellular metabolites. The markers responsible for the discrimination of marine and terrestrial strains were figured out using loading plot from partial least squares discrimination analysis (PLS-DA). Pathway analysis based on PLS-DA, univariate analysis, and correlation analysis of metabolites showed that the major differential metabolites between the terrestrial N. flava and the marine ones were involved in osmotic regulation, redox balancing, and energy metabolism. Together, these insights provide clues as to how the previous living environment of microbes affect their current metabolic performances under laboratory cultivation conditions.","subject_species":"Nesterenkonia flava"},"762":{"study_id":"ST000876","study_title":"Human serum for a patient with neuropathy being treated with L-serine.","study_type":"drug dosage","institute":"University of Helsinki","department":"Molecular Neurology","last_name":"Ylikallio","first_name":"Emil","email":"emil.ylikallio@helsinki.fi","phone":"None","submit_date":"2017-09-05","study_summary":"Oral serine dosing over 52 week study period","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"763":{"study_id":"ST000877","study_title":"Micronutrient deficiencies, environmental exposures and severe malaria: Risk factors for adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in Ugandan children","study_type":"Untargeted high-resolution mass spectrometry profiling","institute":"Emory University","department":"School of Medicine, Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, Critical Care Medicine","last_name":"Walker","first_name":"Douglas","email":"douglas.walker@emory.edu","phone":"(404) 727 5984","submit_date":"2017-09-27","study_summary":"Micronutrient deficiencies and environmental exposures have been to known to adversely impact brain and nervous system functions in adults and children worldwide. However, few studies have examined the short and long-term impact of these risk factors on neurodevelopmental outcomes in children in low-income countries, where the effects are likely to be more pronounced due to limited resources for monitoring and insufficient regulations. Biological risk factors of relevance include micronutrient deficiencies such as zinc and exposure to heavy metals such as lead and mercury. Studies have suggested an association between neurodevelopmental impairment and micronutrient deficiency as well as exposure to a number of heavy metals and environmental toxins. Moreover, findings also suggest that risk factors for adverse developmental outcomes that are independently significant may have the potential for causing cumulative increases in adverse effects. In Sub-Saharan Africa, severe malaria is a leading risk factor for long-term neurocognitive impairment in children. Zinc deficiency or exposure to heavy metals could influence risk of severe malaria, modify the risk of neurocognitive impairment in children with severe malaria, or independently affect risk of neurocognitive impairment. Untargeted analyses for potential environmental exposures or metabolomic changes in children with cerebral malaria vs. without cognitive impairment or in children with higher vs. lower cognitive scores, could also identify new risk factors for neurodevelopmental impairment in Ugandan children with cerebral malaria.In our completed study in Kampala, we assessed neurologic and developmental impairment in children with cerebral malaria [CM] or severe malarial anemia [SMA], as compared to health community children from the same extended household as the children with CM or SMA. As an extension of this study, we are interested in determining levels of micronutrients such as zinc in the population, and in addition, determining exposure levels of heavy metals (lead, mercury, copper, manganese etc.) in samples collected from children with severe malaria and community controls. The primary hypotheses of this study is that nutrient deficiencies or exposure to heavy metals influence short and long term neurocognitive outcomes in healthy community children and in children with severe malaria, and that children with cerebral malaria have specific metabolomic changes that relate to long-term neurocognitive impairment. The specific aims of our study are:Aim 1: To determine levels of zinc, heavy metals, and biomarkers associated with inflammation in children presenting with different forms of severe malaria (SM) and in healthy community children (CC). The working hypothesis of this aim is that 1) children with SM will have lower zinc levels compared to CC; 2) children with SM will present with higher toxic metal exposure and higher levels of biomarkers associated with inflammation than CC.Aim 2: To investigate how micronutrient deficiency, toxic metal exposure and inflammatory biomarkers affect short and long term neurodevelopmental outcomes and growth in children with severe malaria and community children (CC).The working hypothesis of this aim is that the lower levels of zinc, and presence of toxic metals in high concentrations will independently contribute to worsening neurodevelopmental outcomes and worsening growth over time in children with severe malaria and in community children. An alternate hypothesis is that micronutrient deficiency, toxic metal exposure and inflammatory states may interact with each other and with severe malaria to produce greater neurodevelopmental impairment, i.e., that the contribution is not independent but interactive.Aim 3: To determine whether the CSF metabolome differs according to level of neurodevelopmental impairment in children with cerebral malaria. The working hypothesis of this aim is that neurodevelopmental impairment in children with cerebral malaria is associated with changes in the CSF metabolome.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"764":{"study_id":"ST000878","study_title":"Fatty Acid Oxidation is Impaired in An Orthologous Mouse Model of Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease","study_type":"","institute":"University of California, Davis","department":"Genome and Biomedical Sciences Facility","last_name":"Fiehn","first_name":"Oliver","email":"ofiehn@ucdavis.edu","phone":"(530) 754-8258","submit_date":"2017-09-11","study_summary":"Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD; MIM ID's 173900, 601313, 613095) is estimated to affect almost 1\/1000 and is the most common genetic cause of end stage renal disease (Torres et al., 2007). While advances have been made in slowing the progression of some other forms of chronic kidney disease, standard treatments have not reduced the need for renal replacement therapy in ADPKD (Spithoven et al., 2014). Unfortunately, several experimental interventions also have recently failed to show significant benefit in slowing the rate of functional decline (Serra et al., 2010; Walz et al., 2010; Schrier et al., 2014; Torres et al., 2014), and the only positive study reported very modest effects (Torres et al., 2012). These findings suggest new treatment strategies are required. A central dogma of molecular genetics is that discovery of the causative genes will lead to identification of key pathways and potential targets for intervention. In the case of ADPKD, the two genes mutated in the disorder, PKD1 and PKD2, were identified almost 20 years ago and yet their functions remain poorly understood. The PKD1 gene product, polycystin-1 (PC1), encodes a large membrane protein that requires the PKD2 gene product, polycystin-2 (PC2), for its trafficking to the primary cilium where the two are thought to form a receptor channel complex (Kim et al., 2014; Cai et al., 2014). What the complex senses and what it signals remains controversial. The primary cilium has emerged as a key player in the pathogenesis of PKD as mutations in dozens of different genes that encode either essential ciliary components or factors in ciliary signaling pathways result in PKD. A recent report suggests that the relationship between the polycystin complex and ciliary signaling is complicated, however.While ablation of primary cilia by mutation of core ciliary components results in cysts, these same perturbations done in the setting of Pkd1 or Pkd2 inactivation results in significant attenuation of cystic disease (Ma et al., 2013). These data suggest that the polycystin complex provides a suppressive signal for a novel, cilia-dependent growth-promoting pathway that is independent of MAPK\/ERK, mTOR, or cAMP pathways, three effector pathways previously implicated as major drivers of cyst growth. The identities of the growth-promoting and growth-inhibiting pathways remain unknown. We have taken a systems-based approach to study Pkd1 gene function. Building on our previous work identifying markedly different outcomes in animals with induced Pkd1 inactivation before or after P12 and correlating this susceptibility with metabolic status (Piontek et al., 2007; Menezes et al., 2012), we now show that female sex is partially protective in adult-induced Pkd1 inactivation, that sex differences in metabolic status may account for this effect, and that cells lacking Pkd1 have abnormal fatty acid oxidation. Finally, manipulating diet in Pkd1 mouse models, we demonstrate a positive correlation between lipid content in mouse chow and cystic kidney disease severity. Our results therefore suggest that abnormal lipid metabolism is an intrinsic component of PKD and an important modifier of disease progression.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"765":{"study_id":"ST000879","study_title":"Diet, genetics and gut microbiome drive dynamic changes in plasma metabolites [plasma]","study_type":"Plasma data","institute":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard","department":"","last_name":"Avila-Pacheco","first_name":"Julian","email":"jravilap@broadinstitute.org","phone":"617-714-8264","submit_date":"2017-10-02","study_summary":"C57BL\/6J mice (B6) and 129S1 mice (129J) were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and 129S6 mice (129T) were purchased from Taconic Farms (Germantown, NY).

Indications include the preferential attraction of the Anopheles mosquito vector upon infection and a distinct breath profile with the progression of experimental, sub-microscopic malaria. However, these observations have yet to be extended to the clinic. To investigate whether natural human malaria infection leads to a characteristic breath profile, we performed a field study in Malawi. Breath volatiles from pediatric patients with and without uncomplicated falciparum malaria were analyzed by thermal desorption-gas chromatography\/mass spectrometry. Using an unbiased, correlation-based analysis, we find that children with malaria have a distinct shift in overall breath composition. Leveraging these differences, highly accurate classification of infection status was achieved with a suite of six compounds. In addition, we find that malaria-infected children have significantly higher breath levels of two mosquito-attractant terpenes, \u03b1-pinene and 3-carene. Thus, our work attests to the viability of breath analysis for malaria diagnosis, identifies candidate compounds for follow-up studies, and identifies biologically plausible chemical mediators for increased mosquito attraction to malaria-infected patients.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"770":{"study_id":"ST000884","study_title":"Evidence that COG0325 proteins are involved in PLP homeostasis","study_type":"","institute":"University of California, Davis","department":"Genome and Biomedical Sciences Facility","last_name":"Fiehn","first_name":"Oliver","email":"ofiehn@ucdavis.edu","phone":"(530) 754-8258","submit_date":"2017-09-14","study_summary":"Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) is an essential cofactor for nearly 60 Escherichia coli enzymes but is a highly reactive molecule that is toxic in its free form.

Various pleiotropic phenotypes of the E. coli COG0325 (yggS) mutant have been reported, some of which were reproduced and extended in this study. Comparative genomic, genetic and metabolic analyses suggest that these phenotypes reflect an imbalance in PLP homeostasis. The E. coli yggS mutant accumulates the PLP precursor pyridoxine 5'-phosphate (PNP) and is sensitive to an excess of pyridoxine but not of pyridoxal. The pyridoxine toxicity phenotype is complemented by the expression of eukaryotic yggS orthologs. It is also suppressed by the presence of amino acids, specifically isoleucine, threonine and leucine, suggesting the PLP-dependent enzyme transaminase B (IlvE) is affected.

Recent studies have identified exercise-induced resistance to arrhythmia is due to the preservation of mitochondrial membrane potential. To identify novel metabolic changes that occurred parallel to these mitochondrial alterations, we performed non-targeted metabolomics analysis on hearts from sedentary (Sed) and exercise- trained (Ex) rats challenged with isolated heart ischemia-reperfusion injury (I\/R). Eight weeks old Sprague- Dawley rats were treadmill trained five days\/week for six weeks (exercise duration and intensity progressively increased to 1 hour at 30 m\/min up to 10.5% incline, 75-80% VO2mx). The recovery of pre-ischemic function for sedentary rat hearts was 28.8+\/-5.4% (N=12) compared to exercise trained hearts which recovered 51.9%+\/-5.7 (N=14)(p<0.001). Non-targeted GC-MS metabolomics analysis of 1) Sedentary rat hearts; 2) Exercise-trained rat hearts; 3) Sedentary rat hearts challenged with global ischemia-reperfusion (I\/R) injury; and 4) Exercise-trained rat hearts challeged with global I\/R (10\/group) revealed 20 statistically significant metabolites between groups by ANOVA using Metaboanalyst (p<0.001). Enrichment analysis of these metabolites for pathway-associated metabolic sets indicated a >10 fold enrichment for ammonia recycling and protein biosynthesis (L-Glutamic acid; L-Proline; L-Histidine; L-Serine; L-Aspartic acid; L-Glutamine)(p<=4.05E-05, FDR=0.0024). Subsequent comparison of the sedentary hearts post-I\/R and exercise-trained hearts post-I\/R further identified significant differences in metabolites related to Aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis and nitrogen metabolism (4) (p<=1.24E-05, FDR<=5.07E-4). These studies shed light on novel mechanisms in which exercise-induced cardioprotection occurs in I\/R which complement both the mitochondrial stabilization and antioxidant mechanisms recently described.

The S epimer is reconverted to NAD(P)H by a dehydratase; the epimerase facilitates epimer interconversion. Epimerase deficiency in humans causes a lethal disorder attributed to NADHX accumulation. However, bioinformatic evidence suggests caution about this attribution by predicting that the epimerase has a second function connected to vitamin B6 (pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and related compounds). Specifically, (i) the epimerase is fused to a B6 salvage enzyme in plants, (ii) epimerase genes cluster on the chromosome with B6-related genes in bacteria, and (iii) epimerase and B6-related genes are coexpressed in yeast and Arabidopsis. The predicted second function was explored in Escherichia coli, whose epimerase and dehydratase are fused and encoded by the yjeF gene. The putative NAD(P)HX epimerase active site has a conserved lysine residue (K192 in E. coli YjeF). Changing this residue to alanine cut in-vitro epimerase activity by \u226595% but did not affect dehydratase activity. Mutant cells carrying the K192A mutation had essentially normal NAD(P)HX levels, showing that the mutation had very little or no effect on NAD(P)HX repair in vivo. However, these cells showed metabolome changes, particularly in amino acids, that exceeded those in cells lacking the entire yjeF gene. The K192A mutant cells also had lower levels of free pyridoxal 5'-phosphate than wild-type cells. These results provide strong circumstantial evidence that the epimerase has a metabolic function beyond NAD(P)HX repair and that this function involves vitamin B6.","subject_species":"Escherichia coli"},"787":{"study_id":"ST000901","study_title":"Omega-6 and omega-3 oxylipins are implicated in soybean oil-induced obesity in mice - Plasma (part V)","study_type":"","institute":"University of California, Davis","department":"","last_name":"Yang","first_name":"Jun","email":"junyang@ucdavis.edu","phone":"5307525109","submit_date":"2017-07-26","study_summary":"Characterization and analysis of metabolomic, proteomic and metabolic profiles of C57\/Bl6N mice fed various high fat diets","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"788":{"study_id":"ST000902","study_title":"Omega-6 and omega-3 oxylipins are implicated in soybean oil-induced obesity in mice - Liver (part VI)","study_type":"","institute":"University of California, Davis","department":"","last_name":"Yang","first_name":"Jun","email":"junyang@ucdavis.edu","phone":"5307525109","submit_date":"2017-07-26","study_summary":"Characterization and analysis of metabolomic, proteomic and metabolic profiles of C57\/Bl6N mice fed various high fat diets","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"789":{"study_id":"ST000903","study_title":"Pharmacometabolomic analysis of rat hippocampus and plasma in response to chronic stress and albiflorin treament","study_type":"Animal study","institute":"Beijing Wonner Biotech.

However, the unique adaptive mechanisms that enable the survival of marine microorganisms under low temperature are unclear. Since low temperature is always accompanied by high pressure and other adverse conditions in marine environment, here we studied the metabolic adaptation of a marine strain to prolonged low temperature under high pressure. The strain studied is a psychrotolerant Microbacterium sediminis isolated from deep sea sediment. By using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics approach, we detected the spectral data of polar extracts of the strain M. sediminis, and applied multivariate statistical analysis methods together with univariate analysis to analyze metabolic profiles associated to different conditions. The metabolic profiles of the M. sediminis strain cultivated under high pressure at low temperature were distinctly different from those cultivated under high pressure at normal temperature. We identified the differential metabolites which were responsible for distinguishing the metabolic profiles and compared their relative intensities between groups. We also compared the different adaptive responses of the strain at different growth stages to the prolonged low temperature under high pressure. We proposed that the low-temperature adapting process of the M. sediminis strain involves, 1) the regulation of osmotic pressure using amino acids as possible alternative osmolytes, and, 2) the strengthen of glycolysis and the maintenance of TCA cycle via amino acids anaplerotic reaction. We put forward that the main difference of adaptation to low temperature for the strain at different growth stages was related to energy metabolism. Our findings improved the understanding of the low-temperature adaptive mechanisms for marine microorganisms under high pressure on the metabolic level.","subject_species":"Microbacterium sediminis"},"801":{"study_id":"ST000915","study_title":"Biomarkers of NAFLD progression: a lipidomics approach to an epidemic.

When we investigated the effects of allelopathy on the lipidomes of two competing phytoplankton, Asterionellopsis glacialis and Thalassiosira pseudonana using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS)- based metabolomics, we found that the lipidomes of both species were significantly altered, however A. glacialis maintained a more robust response whereas T. pseudonana saw significant alterations in fatty acid synthesis, cell membrane integrity, and a decrease in photosynthetic efficiency. Membrane- associated lipids were significantly suppressed for T. pseudonana exposed to allelopathy to the point of permeabilizing the cell membrane of living cells.

A total of 546 stool samples were analyzed using a platform comprised of four complementary liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) methods designed to measure polar metabolites and lipids.

This has led to LVADs increasing utilization as both a bridge or destination therapy for heart failure. While distinct metabolic changes occur in the human myocardium with LVAD placement, the specific molecular mechanisms underlying these changes have not been identified. Objectives: To identify the role of MuRF1 in the metabolic changes in cardiomyocytes unloading in vitro. Methods: HL-1 atrial cardiomyocyte cells were plated on silastic membranes coated with gelatin\/fibronectin and transduced with AdshRNA MuRF1 (or AdshRNA Scramble control) to knock-down MuRF1 protein to <25% of controls and subjected to 15% biaxial stretch at 1 Hz using the Flexcell FX-5000\u2122 Compression System in serum free DMEM (or no-stretch). After 6 hours stretch, media was collected in parallel with time-matched no-stretch controls, followed by serial collections at 1, 3, 6, and 12 hours unloading (i.e. after termination of stretch). Media was analyzed by untargeted metabolomics using GC-MS. Results: After 6 hours stretch, control HL-1 cell media (AdshRNA Scramble) had 19 significantly altered metabolites compared to non-stretched control cell media (AdshRNA Scramble) by t-test, involved in: 1) glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism (p=0.00087043, FDR=0.071375), 2) methane metabolism (p=0.0041113, FDR=0.089824), 3) glycine, serine and threonine metabolism (p=0.0043816, FDR=0.089824), and 4) aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis(p=0.0060141, FDR=0.09863). To determine the role of MuRF1 in stretch, we additionally compared the AdshRNA Scramble groups to AdshRNA MuRF1 +\/- stretch at 6 hours and identified 41 significant metabolites (of 79 identified) by ANOVA, involved in: 1) phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis (p=0.0036482, FDR=0.05983), 2) aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis (p=3.74E-07, FDR=3.06E-05), and 3) valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis (p=0.0021624, FDR=0.053255). We next compared the 6 hour stretch time point of the four groups to the 1, 3, 6, and 12 hours unloading conditions to identify MuRF1-associated metabolites during the unloading period. At 12 hours of unloading (representative 1, 3, and 6 hours unloading), MuRF1 knock-down cell media had 35 (of 82 named metabolites) significantly different metabolites by ANOVA involved in 1) phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis (p=0.0023668, FDR=0.048519), 2) aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis (p=0.0011403, FDR=0.0032631), 3) phenylalanine metabolism (P= 0.0011403, FDR 0.042673),and arginine and proline metabolism (p=0.0015612, FDR 0.042673). A final analysis comparing all four groups across all five time points identified 21 significant metabolites. When MuRF1 was knocked down (no stretch), these 21 metabolites were significantly increased without stretch. In response to stretch and unloading, these metabolites were further decreased in AdshRNA Scramble (control) cell media decreased. In contrast, these stretch and unloading induced decreases were attenuated in AdshRNA MuRF1 cell media. These metabolites included nine (9) amino acids (citrulline, phenylalanine, tyrosine, asparagine, 2-ketovaline, and -ketoleucine\/ketoisoleucine, threonine, isoleucine, leucine), three (3) metabolic co-factors (Pantothenic acid, Myoinositol, 5,6-Dihydrouracil), and one fatty acid (stearic acid). Conclusion: These studies identify for the first time a role for MuRF1 in generating key amino acids recently reported in LVAD unloading in human myocardium using an in vitro model of atrial cardiomyocyte unloading.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"812":{"study_id":"ST000926","study_title":"Probing the metabolic phenotype of breast cancer cells by multiple tracer stable isotope resolved metabolomics (part I)","study_type":"","institute":"University of Kentucky","department":"","last_name":"Lane","first_name":"Andrew","email":"andrewlane@gmail.com","phone":"8592182868","submit_date":"2018-01-22","study_summary":"Breast cancers vary by their origin and specific set of genetic lesions, which gives rise to distinct phenotypes and differential response to targeted and untargeted chemotherapies.

However, underlying these common symptoms are varying endotypes with distinct pathophysiological processes. Metabolomic studies in patients with asthma are emerging and suggest that metabolomics can characterize distinct asthma phenotypes. In a completed study, we identified a population of patients with asthma who have increased airway hyperresponsiveness (airway hyperresponsiveness is a marker for asthma disease severity) who are characterized by race (African American) and genotype (ADRB2 Arg16\/Arg) compared with patients who have less airway hyperresponsiveness (African Americans and whites with differing ADRB2 genotypes). This group may represent a distinct endotype of asthma with unique metabolomic and lipidomic characteristics. The aims of this project are to (1) use metabolomic and lipidomic analysis to identify metabolites present in plasma in this population of patients with asthma who have increased airway hyperresponsiveness (African Americans who carry the ADRB2 Arg16\/Arg genotype) and patients with asthma who have less airway hyperresponsiveness (African Americans and whites with differing ADRB2 genotypes); and (2) identify pathways that will improve the understanding of increased airway hyperresponsiveness in this population. We hypothesize that there will be unique metabolic pathways in the population with increased airway hyperresponsiveness that will be distinct from pathways in patients with lower airway hyperresponsiveness. In this project will use data and samples that were previously collected as part of the NIH funded project \u201cPharmacogenetics of \u03b22-Agonists in Asthma\u201d (Blake, PI K23 HL081245). Blood was collected in 55 African Americans and whites after receiving 2-weeks treatment with inhaled fluticasone. Samples were stored on ice until processed and plasma frozen at -80\u00b0C. If our findings indicate distinct metabolic pathways are present using global metabolomic and lipodomic analysis, we will seek to replicate our findings using samples and data from phenotypically well characterized participants who participated in trials conducted through the American Lung Association Airways Clinical Research Centers network, of which Nemours has been a highly productive site since 1999. Future controlled trials would be conducted to evaluate treatments based upon molecular pathways identified through metabolomic and lipidomic analysis.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"841":{"study_id":"ST000955","study_title":"Effects of ODC inhibition on T cell metabolism","study_type":"drug treatment at two time","institute":"University of Florida","department":"SECIM","last_name":"Hesterberg","first_name":"Rebecca","email":"rebecca.hesterberg@moffitt.org","phone":"813-270-9181","submit_date":"2018-04-14","study_summary":"Isolated T cells were activated for 48-72 hours in the presence and absence of 5mM DFMO, an ODC inhibitor","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"842":{"study_id":"ST000956","study_title":"Determine metabolomics signatures important for the ability of Streptococus gallolyticus to promote colon cancer cell proliferation","study_type":"","institute":"University of Florida","department":"SECIM","last_name":"Xu","first_name":"Yi","email":"yxu@ibt.tamhsc.edu","phone":"NA","submit_date":"2018-04-14","study_summary":"HT29 cells were treated with Sg TX20005 stationary phase, Sg TX20005 exponential phase (negative control), and Sg TX20008 stationary phase (negative control), and media only (baseline control).

Study of the lipidome in the biology of optic nerve (ON) regeneration has been largely neglected. A better understanding of the roles that lipids play in RGC biology may enhance understanding of RGC-related diseases and point to novel treatments. Established experimental models of ON regeneration allow exploration of molecular determinants of RGC axon regenerative success and failure. In this study, we used high-resolution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to analyze lipidomic profiles of the ON and retina in an ON crush model with and without intravitreal Zymosan injections to enhance regeneration. Our results reveal profound remodeling of retina and ON lipidomes that occur after injury. In the retina, Zymosan treatment largely abrogates widespread lipidome alterations. In the ON, Zymosan induces lipid profiles that are distinct from those observed in na\u00efve and vehicle-injected crush controls. We have identified a number of lipid species, classes and fatty acids that may be involved in the mechanisms of axon damage and repair. Lipids upregulated during RGC regeneration may be interesting candidates for further functional studies.","subject_species":"Rattus norvegicus"},"850":{"study_id":"ST000964","study_title":"U13C Glucose Tracing of Young and Old Pancreatic Islets","study_type":"","institute":"University of California, San Diego","department":"","last_name":"Wortham","first_name":"Matthew","email":"mwortham@ucsd.edu","phone":"8582460588","submit_date":"2018-04-27","study_summary":"Pancreatic islets from young and old mice were traced with either 2.8mM or 16.8mM U13C glucose to determine the effect of age upon glucose metabolism in basal and stimulated states.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"851":{"study_id":"ST000965","study_title":"Timecourse of U13C glucose labeling of pancreatic islets in young mice","study_type":"","institute":"University of California, San Diego","department":"","last_name":"Wortham","first_name":"Matthew","email":"mwortham@ucsd.edu","phone":"8582460588","submit_date":"2018-04-27","study_summary":"Pancreatic islets from young mice were traced with 16.8mM U13C glucose over a 90 minute timecourse to determine the rate of metabolite labeling during glucose stimulation.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"852":{"study_id":"ST000966","study_title":"Metabolite and gene expression profiles suggest a putative mechanism through which high dietary carbohydrates reduce the content of hepatic betaine in Megalobrama amblycephala","study_type":"","institute":"College of Fisheries Huazhong Agricultural University","department":"","last_name":"Xu","first_name":"Jia","email":"xujia2018hzau@163.com","phone":"13018097215","submit_date":"2018-05-04","study_summary":"plasma of Megalobrama amblycephala fed with control diet, high carbohydrates diet,betaine diet with 16 weeks and betaine diet with 4 weeks.","subject_species":"Megalobrama amblycephala"},"853":{"study_id":"ST000967","study_title":"Metabolomics Involved in Early-Life Single Pulse Antibiotic Exposures - Serum (part II)","study_type":"Timecourse treatment Vs control","institute":"University of North Carolina","department":"NIH Eastern Regional Comprehensive Metabolomics Resource Core (RTI RCMRC)","last_name":"Sumner","first_name":"Susan","email":"susan_sumner@unc.edu","phone":"704-250-5066","submit_date":"2018-04-20","study_summary":"The mice serum samples were extracted and analyzed using broad spectrum GCMS for the identification of compounds distinguishing the groups.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"854":{"study_id":"ST000968","study_title":"Impact of thiamine metabolites and spent medium from Chlorella sorokiniana on metabolism in the green algae Auxenochlorella prototheciodes (part I)","study_type":"","institute":"University of California, Davis","department":"Genome and Biomedical Sciences Facility","last_name":"Fiehn","first_name":"Oliver","email":"ofiehn@ucdavis.edu","phone":"(530) 754-8258","submit_date":"2018-05-03","study_summary":"The purpose of this study is to determine how thiamine metabolites impact central metabolism in Auxenochlorella protothecoides when grown in the presence of glucose.

Methods: We used serum samples from a non-human primate (NHP), a baboon (Papio hamadryas), with suitable quality controls to quantify the chemical space using an advanced HR MS platform for confident metabolite identification and robust quantification to assess the suitability of the platform for routine clinical metabolomics research. In a comparative approach, we also analyzed the same serum samples using a two-dimensional gas chromatography time-of-flight mass-spectrometer (2D GC-ToF-MS) for metabolite identification and quantification following established standard protocols. Results: Overall, the 2D GC-ToF-MS and GC-Orbitrap-MS analyses enabled identification and quantification of 555 total metabolites from the NHP serum with a spectral similarity score Rsim \u2265 900 and S\/R ratio of > 25. A common set of 30 metabolites with HMDB and KEGG IDs were quantified in the serum samples by both platforms where the 2D GC-ToF-MS enabled quantification of a total 384 metabolites (118 HMDB IDs) and the GC-Orbitrap-MS analysis quantification of a total 200 metabolites (47 HMDB IDs).

Risk factors for NALFD include obesity, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension\u2014all of which are features of metabolic syndrome. NAFLD is a very heterogeneous disease, as it presents in different patterns in males and females and in patients from different ethnicities, with unclear predictors for development and severity of disease. Previous studies have shown that NAFLD is 1.4 times more frequent in Hispanics than in Caucasians. One of the major challenges in NAFLD is the lack of accurate, noninvasive biomarkers for the detection of the most aggressive presentation, NASH. The gold standard for the diagnosis is liver biopsy, which is an invasive procedure associated with possible complications. Noninvasive diagnosis of NASH is a major unmet medical need and there are no ethnicity-specific biomarkers that can diagnose this condition and predict its progression. Therefore, the main gap in knowledge that this proposal and line of research will address is the characterizing the different plasma and liver metabolomics profile of patients with fatty liver from two ethnicities (Latinos vs. Caucasians) and of both sexes. The overall hypothesis of the present study is that the higher incidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) in Latino patients is reflected in a different plasma and liver metabolomics profile compared to Caucasian patients with further sex-related differences. Characterization of metabolite networks can aid in identifying the mechanistic underpinnings of sex and ethnic driven differences in NAFL which could help diagnose and establish a prognosis of this condition, especially in the critical transition from NAFL to the more aggressive nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).To address this hypothesis, plasma metabolomics profile of samples from male and female Latino and Caucasian bariatric surgery patients with NAFL and from healthy subjects will be compared. Metabolomics findings will be related with liver pathology and liver transcriptome profiles from intraoperatively obtained liver biopsies using correlation, network, and pathway analysis.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"863":{"study_id":"ST000978","study_title":"Metabolomics biomarkers and the risk of overall mortality and ESRD in CKD: results from the Progredir Cohort.","study_type":"ongoing cohort study","institute":"University of Sao Paulo","department":"Clinical Research Center, Universitary Hospital, Sao Paulo University","last_name":"Titan","first_name":"Silvia","email":"smotitan@gmail.com","phone":"+1-413-362-4377","submit_date":"2018-05-22","study_summary":"454 CKD participants were originally recruited from the outpatient services from Hospital das Clinicas, Sao Paulo.

Genetic and environmental factors may disrupt this equilibrium leading to metabolic disorders, including obesity and type 2 diabetes. To identify the genetic factors controlling metabolism, we performed quantitative genetic analysis using a population of 199 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We focused on the genomic regions that control metabolite levels by measuring fatty acid (FA) and amino acid (AA) composition in the RILs using targeted metabolomics. The genetically diverse RILs showed a large variation in their FA and AA levels with a heritability ranging from 32-82%. We detected strongly co-correlated metabolite clusters and 36 significant metabolite QTL (mQTL). We focused on mQTL displaying highly significant linkage and heritability, including an mQTL for the FA C14:1 on Chromosome I, and another mQTL for the FA C18:2 on Chromosome IV. Using introgression lines (ILs) we were able to narrow down both mQTL to a 1.4 Mbp and a 3.6 Mbp region, respectively. RNAi-based screening focusing on the Chromosome I mQTL identified several candidate genes for the C14:1 mQTL, including lagr-1, Y87G2A.2, nhr-265, nhr-276, and nhr-81. Overall, this systems approach provides us with a powerful platform to study the genetic basis of C. elegans metabolism. Furthermore, it allows us to investigate interventions, such as nutrients and stresses that maintain or disturb the regulatory network controlling metabolic homeostasis, and identify gene-by-environment interactions.","subject_species":"Caenorhabditis elegans"},"885":{"study_id":"ST001000","study_title":"Gut microbiome structure and metabolic activity in inflammatory bowel disease","study_type":"","institute":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard","department":"Metabolomics Platform","last_name":"Avila-Pacheco","first_name":"Julian","email":"jravilap@broadinstitute.org","phone":"617-714-8264","submit_date":"2018-07-09","study_summary":"The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which include Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are multifactorial, chronic conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. While IBD has been associated with dramatic changes in the gut microbiota, changes in the gut metabolome -- the molecular interface between host and microbiota -- are less-well understood. To address this gap, we performed untargeted LC-MS metabolomic and shotgun metagenomic profiling of cross-sectional stool samples from discovery (n=155) and validation (n=65) cohorts of CD, UC, and non-IBD control subjects. Metabolomic and metagenomic profiles were broadly correlated with fecal calprotectin levels (a measure of gut inflammation). Across >8,000 measured metabolite features, we identified chemicals and chemical classes that were differentially abundant (DA) in IBD, including enrichments for sphingolipids and bile acids, and depletions for triacylglycerols and tetrapyrroles. While >50% of DA metabolite features were uncharacterized, many could be assigned putative roles through metabolomic \u201cguilt-by-association\u201d (covariation with known metabolites). DA species and functions from the metagenomic profiles reflected adaptation to oxidative stress in the IBD gut, and were individually consistent with previous findings. Integrating these data, however, we identified 122 robust associations between DA species and well-characterized DA metabolites, indicating possible mechanistic relationships that are perturbed in IBD. Finally, we found that metabolome- and metagenome-based classifiers of IBD status were highly accurate and, like the vast majority of individual trends, generalized well to the independent validation cohort. Our findings thus provide an improved understanding of perturbations of the microbiome-metabolome interface in IBD, including identification of many potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"886":{"study_id":"ST001002","study_title":"A pilot study of urine metabolomics in two female and one male subject towards an outpatient estimate of circadian phase using urine storage as a factor (part II)","study_type":"","institute":"Mayo Clinic","department":"","last_name":"Hilaire","first_name":"Melissa","email":"msthilaire@rics.bwh.harvard.edu","phone":"617-732-4013","submit_date":"2018-07-10","study_summary":"Serial urine samples were collected at each void (approximately every 3 hours) from subjects during a 6-day inpatient protocol.

Recent evidence suggests that xenobiotics can disrupt the interaction between the microbiota and host. Here, we describe an approach that combines in vitro microbial incubation (isolated cecal contents from mice), flow cytometry, and mass spectrometry- and 1H NMR-based metabolomics to evaluate xenobiotic-induced microbial toxicity. Tempol, a stabilized free radical scavenger known to remodel the microbial community structure and function in vivo, was studied to assess its direct effects on the gut microbiota. Microbiota were isolated from mouse cecum and were exposed to tempol for 4 h under strict anaerobic condition. The flow cytometry data suggested short term exposure of the microbiota to tempol is associated with disrupted membrane physiology as well as compromised metabolic activity.

Recent evidence suggests that xenobiotics can disrupt the interaction between the microbiota and host. Here, we describe an approach that combines in vitro microbial incubation (isolated cecal contents from mice), flow cytometry, and mass spectrometry- and 1H NMR-based metabolomics to evaluate xenobiotic-induced microbial toxicity. Tempol, a stabilized free radical scavenger known to remodel the microbial community structure and function in vivo, was studied to assess its direct effects on the gut microbiota. Microbiota were isolated from mouse cecum and were exposed to tempol for 4 h under strict anaerobic condition. The flow cytometry data suggested short term exposure of the microbiota to tempol is associated with disrupted membrane physiology as well as compromised metabolic activity. Mass spectrometry and NMR metabolomics revealed that tempol exposure significantly disrupted microbial metabolic activity, specifically indicated by changes in short chain fatty acids, branched chain amino acids, amino acids, nucleotides, glucose, and oligosaccharides. In addition, a mouse study with tempol (5 days gavage) showed similar microbial physiologic and metabolic changes, indicating the in vitro approach reflected in vivo conditions.

While the diverse biological roles of lipids contribute to their clinical utility, the unavailability of lipid internal standards representing each species, make lipid quantitation analytically challenging. The common approach is to employ one or more internal standards for each lipid class examined and use a single point calibration for normalization (relative quantitation). To aid in standardizing and automating this relative quantitation process, we developed LipidMatch Normalizer (LMN) http:\/\/secim.ufl.edu\/secim-tools\/ which can be used in most open source lipidomics workflows. While the effect of lipid structure on relative quantitation has been investigated, applying LMN we show that data-processing can significantly affect lipid semi-quantitative amounts. Polarity and adduct choice had the greatest effect on normalized levels; when calculated using positive versus negative ion mode data, one fourth of lipids had greater than 50 % difference in normalized levels. Based on our study, sodium adducts should not be used for statistics when sodium is not added intentionally to the system, as lipid levels calculated using sodium adducts did not correlate with lipid levels calculated using any other adduct. Relative quantification using smoothing versus not smoothing, and peak area versus peak height, showed minimal differences, except when using peak area for overlapping isomers which were difficult to deconvolute. By characterizing sources or variation introduced during data-processing and introducing automated tools, this work helps increase through-put and improve data-quality for determining relative changes across groups.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"912":{"study_id":"ST001028","study_title":"Metabolic profiling of identified single cells in Xenopus laevis embryos","study_type":"Metabolic profiling of single cells","institute":"University of Maryland","department":"Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry","last_name":"Nemes","first_name":"Peter","email":"nemes@umd.edu","phone":"3014050373","submit_date":"2018-07-25","study_summary":"Single D11 cells were identified in 16-cell embryos of Xenopus laevis.

It is our hope that we will not only learn something about the mechanisms of astrocyte dysregulation in neuromyelitis optica, but that we will learn something about the mechanisms of depression in general that may lead to new therapies for this disease.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"921":{"study_id":"ST001037","study_title":"High Resolution GC-MS and FID Metabolomics of Human Serum","study_type":"Human Serum Analysis","institute":"Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center","department":"Center for Precision Medicine","last_name":"Misra","first_name":"Biswapriya","email":"bbmisraccb@gmail.com","phone":"3522156040","submit_date":"2018-08-13","study_summary":"We explored the possibility of performing quantitative metabolomics using a QEGC-MS using both FID and MS detectors as complementary techniques.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"922":{"study_id":"ST001038","study_title":"Global Metabolomics of the Placenta Reveals Distinct Metabolic Profiles between Maternal and Fetal Placental Tissues Following Delivery in Non-Labored Women","study_type":"Timecourse","institute":"University of Florida","department":"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology","last_name":"Jacquelyn","first_name":"Walejko","email":"jwalejko@ufl.edu","phone":"NA","submit_date":"2018-08-20","study_summary":"We evaluated the metabolic alterations in maternal and fetal placental tissues from non-labored women undergoing cesarean section using samples collected from 5 min to 24 h following delivery.

Our overall hypothesis is that relevant environmental exposures and their interactions drive disease severity in urban children with asthma. We will test this hypothesis by investigating the following aims: Aim 1: To investigate how environmental exposures (ETS, PAHs, phthalates, and VOCs) and their interactions contribute to asthma severity in urban children.

Univariate and multivariate (MVA) statistics were employed. A parsimonious biomarker profile of GC vs HE was investigated using LASSO regularised logistic regression (LASSO-LR). Model performance was assessed using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. Results: GC displayed a clear discriminatory biomarker profile; the BN profile overlapped with GC and HE. LASSO-LR identified three discriminatory metabolites: 2-hydroxyisobutyrate, 3-indoxylsulfate, and alanine, which produced a discriminatory model with an area under the ROC of 0.95.

Early animal models and population studies have begun to identify an association between phenolic chemical exposure and asthma development through proposed increased regulation of an individual\u2019s allergic immune response. This study, nested within a school-based environmental intervention trial, (School Inner-City Asthma Intervention Study, SICAS2) , will enable urinary biomarker analyses during a school-based academic year-long environmental intervention trial to analyze the source and impact of exposures on urinary environmental exposure biomarker levels as well as the relationship between these biomarkers levels and asthma morbidity. We are poised to leverage the clinical and exposure data being collected in the clinical trial and generate cross-sectional urinary phenol biomarker data (at baseline) within the resources of CHEAR. If successful, our study will assess the impact of exposures on these biomarker levels and the impact that these exposures have on asthma morbidity, controlling comprehensively for other personal, home, and school environmental factors associated with asthma outcomes. We hypothesize that exposure to environmental exposures (e.g. phenols, phthalates, environmental tobacco smoke) in urban school children and higher urinary biomarkers will preliminarily be associated with higher asthma morbidity.

Using 1HNMR based untargeted metabolomics we quantified 51 metabolites belonging to 74 different metabolic pathways in the skin and blubber of bottle nose dolphins (n=5) samples collected in 2017 from the coast of Mexico. Results indicate that the skin and blubber metabolism are quantitatively different. These metabolite abundances could help discriminate the tissue-types using supervised and unsupervised PCA and PLSDA analysis. Heat maps and random forest analysis point to unique metabolites that are important classifiers of the tissue-type. The altered metabolic patterns, mainly linking fatty acid metabolism and ketogenic amino acids, seem to constitute a characteristic of blubber, while the skin showed diverse metabolites involved in gluceoneogenic pathways. 1H NMR spectra allowed the identification of metabolites associated with these organ types, such as pyruvic acid, arginine, ornithine, 2-hydroxybutyric acid, 3-hydroxyisobutyric acid, and acetic acid, as discriminatory and classifying metabolites.

GSH is abundant in plants, with reported intracellular concentrations typically in the 1-10 millimolar range. Various aminotransferases can inadvertently transaminate the amino group of the \u03b3-glutamyl moiety of GSH to produce deaminated glutathione (dGSH), a metabolite damage product. It was recently reported that an amidase known as Nit1 participates in dGSH breakdown in mammals and yeast. Plants have a hitherto uncharacterized homolog of the Nit1 amidase. We show that recombinant Arabidopsis Nit1 (At4g08790) has efficient amidase activity towards dGSH. Ablating the Arabidopsis Nit1 gene causes a massive accumulation of dGSH and other marked changes to the metabolome. All plant Nit1 sequences examined had predicted plastidial targeting peptides with a potential second start codon whose use would eliminate the targeting peptide. In vitro transcription\/translation assays show that both potential translation start codons were used and subcellular localization of GFP fusions confirmed both cytosolic and plastidial localization. Further, we show that Arabidopsis enzymes convert GSH to dGSH at a rate of 2.8 pmol min-1 mg-1 in vitro. Our data demonstrate that plants have a dGSH repair system that is directed to at least two subcellular compartments via the use of alternative translation start sites.","subject_species":"Arabidopsis thaliana"},"945":{"study_id":"ST001063","study_title":"Lipidomics analysis for aged mice epididymal adipose tissue (part-I) ","study_type":"MS lipidomics analysis","institute":"Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited","department":"","last_name":"Ando","first_name":"Ayumi","email":"ayumi.kawamura@takeda.com","phone":"+81466-32-4216","submit_date":"2018-09-18","study_summary":"Lipidomics studies on samples from aged and young mice.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"946":{"study_id":"ST001064","study_title":"Nude mice orthotopicly implanted with human glioma cell lines","study_type":"","institute":"Xiamen University","department":"","last_name":"Cui","first_name":"Pengfei","email":"edmundcui@126.com","phone":"15060796092","submit_date":"2018-09-22","study_summary":"Malignant gliomas are considered to be one of the deadliest human cancers, accounting for about 60% of all primary brain tumors. Cachexia is a complex metabolic derangement and muscle atrophy syndrome, which causes high mortalities in patients with advanced cancers including brain tumors. However, cachexia symptoms induced by gliomas and mechanisms underlying muscle atrophy are unclear. Herein, we developed a glioma cachexia model using nude mice orthotopicly implanted with two glioma cell lines (WHO II CHG5 and WHO IV U87). U87 mice developed more severe cachexia symptoms than CHG5 mice, including more evident anorexia, greater body weight loss and mortality. Unlike non-central nervous system cancer cachexia, glioma cachexia did not induce remarkable systemic inflammation but massive multi-organ atrophy. It also caused significantly decreased skeletal muscle mass and strength, which were associated with down-regulated myosin and AKT, and up-regulated AMPK, FOXO and Atrogin1. Interestingly, expressions of MuRF1, MyoD1, eIF3f, desmin and vimentin were not significantly changed. Consistently, NMR-based metabolomic analyses revealed pronounced metabolic derangements in cachectic gastrocnemius relative to controls. Glucose, glycerol, 3-hydroxybutyrate and glycine were remarkably down-regulated, whereas largely released amino acids due to proteolysis including glutamate, arginine, leucine and isoleucine were up-regulated in cachectic gastrocnemius.

However, specific mechanisms affecting disease susceptibility related to complex commensal bacterial mixtures are poorly understood. We used a multi-omics approach to determine how differences in the complex gut microbiome (GM) influence the metabolome and host transcriptome and ultimately affect susceptibility to adenoma development. Fecal samples collected from a preclinical rat model of colon cancer harboring distinct complex GMs were analyzed using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS). We collected samples prior to observable disease onset and identified putative metabolite profiles that predicted future disease severity, independent of GM status. Transcriptome analyses performed after disease onset from normal epithelium and tumor tissues between the high and low tumor GMs suggests that the GM is also correlated with altered host gene expression. Integrated pathway (IP) analyses of the metabolome and transcriptome based on putatively identified metabolic features indicate that bile acid biosynthesis was enriched in rats with high tumors (GM:F344) along with increased fatty acid metabolism and mucin biosynthesis. These data emphasize the utility of using untargeted metabolomics to reveal signatures of susceptibility and resistance and integrated analysis reveals common pathways that are likely to be universal targets for intervention.","subject_species":"Rattus norvegicus"},"958":{"study_id":"ST001076","study_title":"Multi-platform metabolomics data from Ndufs4-\/- skeletal muscles (part - I)","study_type":"Targeted LC-MS\/MS of Ndufs4-\/- white quadriceps muscles","institute":"North-West University","department":"","last_name":"Louw","first_name":"Roan","email":"Roan.Louw@nwu.ac.za","phone":"+27 18 299 4074","submit_date":"2018-10-17","study_summary":"Targeted LC-MS\/MS analysis of amino acids and acylcarnitines in Ndufs4-\/- and WT mouse white quadriceps muscles.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"959":{"study_id":"ST001077","study_title":"Multi-platform metabolomics data from Ndufs4-\/- skeletal muscles (part-II)","study_type":"Targeted LC-MS\/MS of Ndufs4-\/- soleus muscles","institute":"North-West University","department":"","last_name":"Louw","first_name":"Roan","email":"Roan.Louw@nwu.ac.za","phone":"+27 18 299 4074","submit_date":"2018-10-16","study_summary":"Targeted analysis of amino acids and acylcarnitines in mouse Ndufs4-\/- and WT soleus muscles","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"960":{"study_id":"ST001078","study_title":"Multi-platform metabolomics data from Ndufs4-\/- skeletal muscles (part-V)","study_type":"NMR analysis of Ndufs4-\/- white quadriceps muscles","institute":"North-West University","department":"","last_name":"Louw","first_name":"Roan","email":"Roan.Louw@nwu.ac.za","phone":"+27 18 299 4074","submit_date":"2018-10-18","study_summary":"NMR analysis of Ndufs4-\/- and WT mouse white quadriceps muscles","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"961":{"study_id":"ST001080","study_title":"Dynamic labeling of intracellular metabolites in PCC 7002","study_type":"Timecourse experiment","institute":"Indian Institute of Technology Bombay","department":"Department of Chemical Engineering","last_name":"Wangikar","first_name":"Pramod","email":"wangikar@iit.ac.in","phone":"2225767232","submit_date":"2018-10-18","study_summary":"The experiment was conducted in a reactor at a metabolic steady state (OD 730 nm = 0.8). 13C labeled sodium bicarbonate was used as a tracer.

In the present study, we utilized a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomic approach supported by the 16S rRNA next-generation sequencing to investigate the functional and taxonomical differences between paired tumor and unaffected (normal) surgical biopsy tissues from 17 Malaysian patients. Metabolomic differences associated with steroid biosynthesis, terpenoid biosynthesis and bile metabolism could be attributed to microbiome differences between normal and tumor sites. The relative abundances of Anaerotruncus, Intestinimonas and Oscillibacter displayed significant relationships with both steroid biosynthesis and terpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis pathways. Metabolites involved in serotonergic synapse\/ tryptophan metabolism (Serotonin and 5-Hydroxy-3-indoleacetic acid [5-HIAA]) were only detected in normal tissue samples. On the other hand, S-Adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH), a metabolite involves in methionine metabolism and methylation, was frequently increased in tumor relative to normal tissues. In conclusion, this study suggests that local microbiome dysbiosis may contribute to functional changes at the cancer sites.

It plays a protective role in pathogenic processes such as intestinal colitis and tumorigenesis in a microbiome dependent manner. Host innate immunity and changes in microbial diversity also play a role in the severity of allo-immune-mediated gastrointestinal pathogenic process, namely graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), the principal toxicity after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT). Herein, we examined the role of NLRP6 in multiple murine models of allo-BMT. In contrast to its role in intestinal colitis, host NLRP6 aggravated GI GVHD. NLRP6-deficient animals showed improved intestinal barrier function, increased levels of tissue repair associated proteins and preserved Goblet and Paneth cell numbers in the GI tract after allo-BMT. The impact of host NLRP6 deficiency in mitigating GVHD was observed regardless of co-housing, antibiotic treatment, or colonizing littermate germ free wild type (WT) and NLRP6 deficient hosts with fecal microbial transplantation from SPF WT and Nlrp6-\/- animals. Chimera studies were performed to assess the role of NLRP6 expression on host hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells. The allogeneic [B6Ly5.2\u2192Nlrp6-\/-] animals demonstrated significantly improved survival compared to the allogeneic [B6Ly5.2\u2192B6] animals, demonstrating that the absence of NLRP6 in host non-hematopoietic cells is crucial for the protection against GVHD, but did not alter the therapeutic graft-versus-tumor effects after BMT. Our results unveil a novel role for NLRP6 and demonstrate a pathogenic role in GVHD that is independent of variations in its intestinal microbiome in contrast to its well-appreciated microbiome-dependent protective role in intestinal colitis and tumorigenesis.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"971":{"study_id":"ST001090","study_title":"NMR metabolomics study of Gemcitabine resistant cancer cells","study_type":"NMR metabolomics","institute":"University of Nebraska-Lincoln","department":"Chemistry","last_name":"Gebregiworgis","first_name":"Teklab","email":"teklab@huskers.unl.edu","phone":"(402) 472-3039","submit_date":"2018-09-25","study_summary":"1D 1H NMR spectra were collected from the samples and analyzed using MVAPACK software (http:\/\/bionmr.unl.edu\/mvapack.php).

In recent meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials in humans, daily aspirin use reduced incidence, metastasis and mortality from several common types of cancer, especially colorectal cancer. The mechanism(s) by which aspirin exerts an anticancer benefit is uncertain; numerous effects have been described involving both cyclooxygenase-dependent and -independent pathways. The goal of this research is to elucidate the key metabolic changes that are responsible for the anticancer effects of aspirin in humans using untargeted metabolomics analysis. Metabolomics, or global metabolite profiling, is an emerging discipline that has the potential to transform the study of pharmaceutical agents. Our innovative approach will use high-resolution mass spectroscopy to detect thousands of metabolites in blood plasma and normal colon mucosa biopsies that were collected from participants in the Aspirin\/Folate Polyp Prevention Study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of aspirin and\/or folic acid supplementation for the prevention of colorectal adenomas. Participants in the trial were assigned with equal probability to three aspirin treatment arms (placebo, 81 mg, or 325 mg daily). Over the three-year treatment period, 81 mg\/day of aspirin reduced the risk of adenomas, whereas the 325 mg\/day dose had less effect. The aims of the current proposal are to identify metabolomic signatures, including specific metabolites and metabolic pathways, that are associated with aspirin treatment in blood and normal colon mucosal tissue of participants after three years of randomized aspirin treatment; and then to assess the associations of these metabolic signatures with adenoma risk and whether they mediate the reductions in risk due to 81 mg\/day aspirin treatment. We will prioritize metabolites for study by evaluating metabolite levels in patients from the placebo and treatment arms while controlling the false discovery rate, use correlation analysis to enhance identification of relevant metabolic modules associated with these prioritized metabolites, and apply pathway mapping with post-hoc application of ion dissociation spectroscopy to representative metabolites to confirm pathway identification. Because aspirin is a multifunctional drug that is thought to modify numerous pathways with potential roles in carcinogenesis, a global discovery-based metabolomics approach is the best way to identify its key activities. The public health significance of this work is substantial because understanding the mechanism of aspirin\u2019s anticancer effects is key to optimizing its use and to the development of novel drugs targeting the metabolic pathways identified.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"973":{"study_id":"ST001092","study_title":"Metabolic profiling by NMR analysis in liver aqueous extract samples","study_type":"Time Course","institute":"Pennsylvania State University","department":"","last_name":"Omiecinski","first_name":"Curt","email":"cjo10@psu.edu, dmw178@psu.edu","phone":"8148651572","submit_date":"2018-09-11","study_summary":"Liver tissue were harvested from wild type and CAR knockout mice treated for 48 or 72h with or without TCPOBOP.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"974":{"study_id":"ST001093","study_title":"Impact of genetic suppression (shRNA) of ALDH1A1 expression in human colon cancer cell line (COLO320)","study_type":"Untargeted metabolomics","institute":"Yale University","department":"","last_name":"Vasiliou","first_name":"Vasilis","email":"georgia.charkoftaki@yale.edu; vasilis.vasiliou@yale.edu","phone":"203.737.8094","submit_date":"2018-11-12","study_summary":"Using a multi-omics approach, we have investigated the impact of genetic suppression (shRNA) of ALDH1A1 expression on transcriptomics, proteomics and untargeted metabolomics analyses in a human colon cancer cell line (COLO320).

DESIGN Metabolomics analysis. PARTICIPANTS Ninety-four adult patients with schizophrenia who were taking an AAP for at least 6 months, with no changes in their antipsychotic regimen for the previous 8 weeks, and who did not require treatment with insulin. Twenty age- and sex-matched nonobese (10 subjects) and obese (10 subjects) controls without cardiovascular disease or mental health diagnoses were used to match the body mass index range of the patients with schizophrenia to account for metabolite concentration differences attributable to body mass index. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Existing serum samples were used to identify aqueous metabolites (to differentiate fasting insulin concentration quartiles) and fatty acids with quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and gas chromatography (GC) methods, respectively. To exclude metabolites from our pathway mapping analysis that were due to variability in weight, we also subjected serum samples from the nonobese and obese controls to the same analyses. Patients with schizophrenia had a median age of 47.0 (interquartile range 41.0-52.0) years. Using a false discovery rate threshold of <25%, 10 metabolites, not attributable to weight, differentiated insulin concentration quartiles in patients with schizophrenia and identified variability in one-carbon metabolism between groups. Patients with higher fasting insulin concentrations (quartiles 3 and 4) also trended toward having higher levels of saturated fatty acids compared with patients with lower fasting insulin concentrations (quartiles 1 and 2). CONCLUSION These results illustrate the utility of metabolomics to identify pathways underlying variable fasting insulin concentration in patients with schizophrenia.

Patients with higher fasting insulin concentrations (quartiles 3 and 4) also trended toward having higher levels of saturated fatty acids compared with patients with lower fasting insulin concentrations (quartiles 1 and 2). CONCLUSION These results illustrate the utility of metabolomics to identify pathways underlying variable fasting insulin concentration in patients with schizophrenia. Importantly, no significant difference in AAP exposure was observed among groups, suggesting that current antipsychotic use may not be a primary factor that differentiates middle-aged adult patients with schizophrenia by fasting insulin concentration.

We call this technique \u201ccontinuous in vivo metabolism by NMR\u201d (CIVM-NMR). We used isotope-edited CIVM-NMR to reproduce a recent amino acid flux result in chronic lymphoid leukemia cells. We then collected untargeted CIVM-NMR datasets for Neurospora crassa, a classic multicellular model of biochemistry, genetics, and metabolism. CIVM-NMR requires virtually no sample preparation and allows for continuous collection of data over hours to days at ~4-min temporal resolution with little noise. CIVM-NMR provided real-time measurements that unambiguously reproduced the direction of flux of branched-chain amino acid accumulation in leukemia cells. It also revealed the dynamics of central carbon metabolism, amino acid metabolism, energy storage molecules, and lipid and cell wall precursors in N. crassa. CIVM-NMR is simple and readily adapted to different types of cells and microorganisms, making it ideally suited to experimentally complement kinetic models of metabolism for diverse biological systems.","subject_species":"Neurospora crassa"},"984":{"study_id":"ST001104","study_title":"Seryl-leucine core 1 O-glycosylated peptide (SLC1G) identification","study_type":"","institute":"Colorado State University","department":"","last_name":"Fitzgerald","first_name":"Bryna","email":"blfitz@colostate.edu","phone":"9704918905","submit_date":"2018-09-26","study_summary":"An untargeted metabolomics approach was utilized to determine urinary metabolites that could serve as small molecule biomarkers for treatment response to standard tuberculosis treatment.

Increased triglyceride concentration in muscle tissue, as seen with obesity, is associated with inhibition of insulin action and decreased glucose uptake. Here we use liquid chromatography paired with mass spectrometry (LCMS) to identify patterns of lipid species in femoral muscle of mice associated with diet-induced insulin resistance. Mice were fed a standard CHOW diet for 5 weeks or HFD for 5 or 13 weeks. 806 lipids were significantly different (p \u2264 0.05) between HFD-induced insulin resistant muscle and CHOW insulin sensitive. Of these 217 lipid species were quantified and annotated based on principle components analysis, significance (p \u2264 0.01) and fold change of relative abundance values. CHOW insulin sensitive muscle was associated with triglycerides and phospholipids that contained higher abundance of long-chain highly unsaturated fatty acids. Serine and inositol phospholipids favored insulin sensitive femoral muscle, yet higher abundance also occurred in 13 week HFD mice compared with 5 week. Consequently, phospholipid imbalance may be indicative of cell membrane dysfunction. HFD insulin resistant femoral muscle contained triglycerides with less carbons, compared with CHOW, which were predominantly saturated. In addition, there was greater abundance of diacylglycerides and sphingomyelin, but not ceramides. Extending HFD intake to 13 weeks did not cause increased abundance of deleterious lipids with the exception of sphingomyelin. Overall, distinct lipid combinations, perhaps even ratios, should be characterized when identifying what contributes to the maintenance or dysregulation of muscle insulin sensitivity.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"1024":{"study_id":"ST001146","study_title":"Global Nonhuman primate (NHP) urine metabolomics (part-I)","study_type":"Nonhuman primate metabolomics","institute":"Georgetown University","department":"","last_name":"Pannkuk","first_name":"Evan","email":"elp44@georgetown.edu","phone":"2026875650","submit_date":"2019-02-27","study_summary":"Here, we use global metabolomics to differentiate temporal effects (1 \u2013 60 d) found in nonhuman primate (NHP) urine small molecule signatures after a 4 Gy total body irradiation.","subject_species":"Macaca mulatta"},"1025":{"study_id":"ST001147","study_title":"Global NHP serum metabolomics (part-IV)","study_type":"","institute":"Georgetown University","department":"","last_name":"Pannkuk","first_name":"Evan","email":"elp44@georgetown.edu","phone":"2026875650","submit_date":"2019-02-28","study_summary":"Here, we use global metabolomics to differentiate temporal effects (1 \u2013 60 d) found in nonhuman primate (NHP) serum small molecule signatures after a 4 Gy total body irradiation.","subject_species":"Macaca mulatta"},"1026":{"study_id":"ST001148","study_title":"Effect of cell harvesting technique and storage on metabolic profiles in human skin fibroblasts","study_type":"Method","institute":"Mayo Clinic","department":"Neurology","last_name":"Wilkins","first_name":"Jordan","email":"wilkins.jordan@mayo.edu","phone":"5072933857","submit_date":"2019-02-27","study_summary":"Human skin fibroblasts were cultured in MEM media supplemented with 15% FBS.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms contributing to HCC development and progression is highly desirable for improved surveillance, diagnosis and treatment. Liver tissue metabolomics has the potential to reflect the physiological changes behind HCC development. Also, it allows researchers to investigate racial disparities in HCC. The use of both gas chromatography \u2013 mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography \u2013 mass spectrometry (LC-MS) platforms helps increase the metabolome coverage, allowing researchers to better unravel the relationships of metabolites and HCC. The objective of this study is to identify HCC-associated metabolites by analysis of liver tissues from HCC patients using both GC-MS and LC-MS platforms. Paired tumor and non-tumor tissues from 40 patients were analyzed by GC-MS and LC-MS. The patients consist of 14 African-Americans (AA), 10 Asian-Americans (AS), and 16 European-Americans (EA). The levels of the metabolites extracted from the solid liver tissue of the HCC area and adjacent non-HCC area were compared. Among the analytes detected by GC-MS and LC-MS with significant alterations, 17 were selected based on availability of putative metabolite identifications. These metabolites belong to TCA cycle, glycolysis, purines, and lipid metabolism, and have been previously reported in liver metabolomics studies where high correlation with HCC progression was implied. We demonstrated that metabolites that are related to HCC pathogenesis can be identified through metabolomics analysis of liver tissues by both GC-MS and LC-MS. In addition, this analysis has led to the identification of metabolites associated with HCC in a race-specific manner.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"1031":{"study_id":"ST001153","study_title":"Erythrocyte adenosine A2B receptor-mediated AMPK activation: Counteracting CKD by promoting oxygen delivery","study_type":"","institute":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston","department":"McGovern Medical School","last_name":"Xia","first_name":"Yang","email":"yang.xia@uth.tmc.edu","phone":"713-500-5039","submit_date":"2019-02-18","study_summary":"Background: Although the erythrocyte is the most abundant cell type in our body, acting as both a deliverer and sensor of oxygen (O2), its function and regulatory mechanism in chronic kidney disease (CKD) remain unknown. Methods: Unbiased metabolomics screening in the whole blood of mice infused with or without angiotensin II (Ang II) at 140ng\/kg\/min up to 14 days was conducted. Mice with specific ablation of ADORA2B in erythrocytes and patients with CKD were used to determine its function in CKD, potential mechanisms and human relevance. Results: Unbiased metabolomics revealed that 2,3-biphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG), an erythrocyte-specific metabolite promoting O2 delivery, was significantly induced in an experimental model of CKD induced by Ang II. Mouse genetic studies revealed that erythrocyte ADORA2B signaling via AMPK-stimulated activation of BPG mutase was a key compensatory cellular response to counteract kidney hypoxia, tissue damage and disease progression in Ang II-induced CKD by promoting 2,3-BPG production and O2 delivery. Preclinical studies showed that enhancing AMPK activation offset kidney hypoxia by triggering 2,3-BPG production and O2 delivery. Human translational studies validated mouse findings that erythrocyte 2,3-BPG levels, AMPK activity and O2 delivery capacity were significantly induced in the erythrocytes of CKD patients compared to normal controls and their elevations were correlated to disease severity. Conclusion: Overall, we have provided both mouse and human evidence that ADORA2B-AMPK signaling cascade-induced 2,3-BPG production is a beneficial erythrocyte response to promote O2 delivery to counteract kidney hypoxia and progression of CKD. These findings pave a way to novel therapeutic avenues in CKD.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"1032":{"study_id":"ST001154","study_title":"A comprehensive plasma metabolomics dataset for a cohort of mouse knockouts within the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium","study_type":"","institute":"University of California, Davis","department":"Genome Center","last_name":"Barupal","first_name":"Dinesh","email":"dinkumar@ucdavis.edu","phone":"5309794354","submit_date":"2019-03-12","study_summary":"Untargeted and targeted metabolomics datasets were acquired for blood plasma samples of 30 mouse knockouts within the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC). http:\/\/www.mousephenotype.org\/.

The recently developed 2-aminomethylphenol, JPC-3210, (MMV 892646) is an erythrocytic schizonticide with potent in vitro antimalarial activity against multidrug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum, low cytotoxicity, potent in vivo efficacy against murine malaria, and favourable preclinical pharmacokinetics, including a lengthy plasma elimination half-life. This study demonstrates the application of a \u201cmulti-omics\u201d workflow based on high resolution orbitrap mass spectrometry to investigate the impact of JPC-3210 on biochemical pathways within P. falciparum infected red blood cells. Metabolomics and peptidomics analysis revealed a perturbation in hemoglobin metabolism following JPC-3210 exposure. The metabolomics data demonstrated a depletion in short hemoglobin-derived peptides, while peptidomics analysis showed a depletion in longer hemoglobin-derived peptides. In order to further elucidate the mechanism responsible for inhibition of hemoglobin metabolism, we used in vitro \u03b2-hematin polymerisation assays and showed JPC-3210 to be an intermediate inhibitor of \u03b2-hematin polymerisation, about 10-fold less potent then the quinoline antimalarials. Furthermore, quantitative proteomics analysis showed that JPC-3210 treatment results in a distinct proteomic signature in comparison to other known antimalarials. Whilst JPC-3210 clustered closely with mefloquine in the metabolomics and proteomics analyses, a key differentiating signature for JPC-3210 was the significant enrichment of parasite proteins involved in regulation of translation. In conclusion, multi-omics studies using high resolution mass spectrometry revealed JPC-3210 to possess a unique mechanism of action involving inhibition of hemoglobin digestion, depletion of DNA replication and synthesis proteins, and elevation of regulators of protein translation. Importantly, this mechanism is distinct from currently-used antimalarials, suggesting that JPC-3210 warrants further investigation as a potentially useful new antimalarial agent.","subject_species":"Plasmodium falciparum"},"1054":{"study_id":"ST001176","study_title":"Metabolite changes in human plasma before and after YF17D vaccination in symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects","study_type":"","institute":"Duke-NUS Medical School","department":"","last_name":"Chan","first_name":"Kuan Rong","email":"kuanrong.chan@duke-nus.edu.sg","phone":"90058277","submit_date":"2019-04-25","study_summary":"Plasma was taken before and 1 day post-YF17D vaccination in a total of 13 subjects, of which 6 were asymptomatic and 7 were symptomatic.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"1055":{"study_id":"ST001177","study_title":"Analysis of short chain phosphatidylcholine (PC) on the Golgi membrane","study_type":"Golgi membrane lipids characterization","institute":"University of Kentucky","department":"","last_name":"Morris","first_name":"Andrew","email":"a.j.morris@uky.edu","phone":"859-323-3749","submit_date":"2019-04-25","study_summary":"Studies on vesicle formation by the Coat Protein I (COPI) complex have contributed to a basic understanding of how vesicular transport is initiated.

Cordyceps militaris (C. militaris) is a commonly used substitute for O. sinensis. A metabolomic-based approach for exploring the similarities and differences in the metabolites of O. sinensis and C. militaris in water-boiled and 50% ethanol-soaked extracts is of great significance. Objectives To determine a vital role of extraction methodologies in influencing the metabolic composition of herbs, 1HNMR-based profiling was used to characterize the metabolic fingerprints of O. sinensis and C. militaris. Methods To make a distinction between the global metabolite profiling of O. sinensis and C. militaris extracts obtained from either the water-boiled or 50% ethanol-soaked methods, we screened the herbs samples using 1HNMR-based metabolic fingerprints combined with multivariate statistical analysis. Results This study revealed that a total of 43 (82.69% of 52) metabolites were detectable in both O. sinensis and C. militaris. According to the variable importance in projection (VIP) value and p-value from the Mann-Whitney test, 7 metabolites (alanine, aspartate, glutamate, mannitol, ornithine, serine, and trehalose) differed between O. sinensis and C. militaris. Arginine, glucose, putrescine, pyroglutamate, betaine, O-phosphocholine, and xylose differed significantly between the water-boiled and 50% ethanol-soaked methods used to prepare the herb extracts. Conclusion A total of 52 primary metabolites were identified and quantified from O. sinensis and C. militaris samples. The study suggests that a water-boiled extraction is much faster method and strongly recommended over the 50% ethanol-soaked method for both O. sinensis and C. militaris.","subject_species":"Ophiocordyceps sinensis;Cordyceps militaris"},"1068":{"study_id":"ST001190","study_title":"Sepsis-related metabolic changes in ileum, jejunum, skeletal muscle, liver and lung","study_type":"","institute":"Indiana University School of Medicine","department":"Indiana Center for Musculoskeletal Health \/ Dept. of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine","last_name":"Willis","first_name":"Monte","email":"monte_willis@outlook.com","phone":"(984) 999-5431","submit_date":"2018-12-03","study_summary":"Rationale: Sepsis is a multi-organ disease affecting the ileum and jejunum (small intestine),liver, skeletal muscle, and lung clinically. Recently, specific alterations in circulating metabolites have been found in patients with sepsis which are thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of disease. The specific metabolic changes in the ileum, jejunum, liver, skeletal muscle, and lung have not previously been investigated. Methods: Live Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from a patient was given via IV catheter to pigs  to induce severe sepsis. Eighteen hours later, ileum, jejunum, medial gastrocnemius skeletal muscle, liver,  and lung were harvested and flash frozen. Tissues were subsequently processed for non-targeted metabolomics analysis using gas chromatography\/mass spectrometry. Results: After 18 hours of sepsis, the ileum and the liver demonstrated significant changes in  metabolites involved in linoleic acid metabolism, the ileum and lung had significant changes in  valine\/leucine\/isoleucine metabolism, the jejunum, skeletal muscle, and liver had significant changes in  arginine\/ proline metabolism, and the skeletal muscle and lung had significant changes in aminoacyl-tRNA  biosynthesis by pathway analysis. Pathway analysis also identified changes in metabolic pathways unique for different tissues, including changes in the citric acid cycle (jejunum), beta-alanine metabolism (skeletal muscle), and purine metabolism (liver). Conclusion: These findings demonstrate both overlapping metabolic pathways affected in different tissues and those that are unique to others and provide insight into the metabolic changes in sepsis leading to organ dysfunction. This may allow therapeutic interventions that focus on multiple tissues or single tissues once the relationship of the altered metabolites\/metabolism to the underlying pathogenesis of sepsis is determined.","subject_species":"Sus scrofa"},"1069":{"study_id":"ST001191","study_title":"Metabolome of ginsenoside anti-tumor","study_type":"Metabonomics","institute":"Nankai University","department":"State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology","last_name":"Zhihua","first_name":"Wang","email":"15822278821@163.com","phone":"02285358344","submit_date":"2019-06-09","study_summary":"Metabonome profiling analysis reveals the protein-metabolite interaction network of ginsenoside anti-tumor","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"1070":{"study_id":"ST001192","study_title":"A library of human gut bacterial isolates paired with longitudinal multiomics data enables mechanistic microbiome research","study_type":"Stool metabolite profiling","institute":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard","department":"","last_name":"Avila-Pacheco","first_name":"Julian","email":"jravilap@broadinstitute.org","phone":"617-714-8264","submit_date":"2019-06-10","study_summary":"Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is used in the treatment of microbiome-associated diseases such as Clostridium difficile infections.

Thus, artificial planting and industrial harvesting become the vital aspect to get higher drug yields. In this research, we performed de novo transcriptome sequencing of Ginkgo leaves coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography\/quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry analyses to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the influence of elevation and plant age on flavonoid synthesis. A total of 557,659,530 clean reads were assembled into 188,155 unigenes, of which 135,102 (71.80%) were successfully annotated in seven public databases. The differentially expressed genes analysis indicated DFR, LAR and ANR were significantly up-regulated with the increase of elevation in young Ginkgo trees leaves. With less strict saliency, the relative concentration of flavonoid derivatives with high parent ion signal intensity was likely to support this conclusion. Complex gene variations were observed with the plant age change. However, flavonoid derivatives analysis predicted the potential possibility that the rise of plant age is more likely to be detrimental to the biosynthesis of Ginkgo flavonoids in leaves. From the overall DEGs involved in flavonoid biosynthesis, DFRs seemed to show more considerable variability towards the variation of elevation and plant age. Furthermore, our research effectively expanded the functional genomic library of Ginkgo and provided a reference for artificial planting and industrial harvesting.","subject_species":"Ginkgo Biloba"},"1073":{"study_id":"ST001195","study_title":"Non-targeted GC-MS Analysis of Polar Soluble Fraction (part-I)","study_type":"","institute":"Colorado State University","department":"Chemical and Biological Engineering","last_name":"Peebles","first_name":"Christie","email":"christie.peebles@colostate.edu","phone":"970-491-6779","submit_date":"2019-03-02","study_summary":"Cyanobacteria are a model photoautotroph and a chassis for the sustainable production of fuels and chemicals.

Vitamin D sufficient (D+) mice had significantly higher frequencies of FoxP3+ and RORgt\/FoxP3+ T reg cells in the colon compared to vitamin D deficient (D-) mice.

Early infection typically presents as generalized symptoms with an erythema migrans (EM) skin lesion. Bacterial dissemination can result in multiple EM skin lesions or in extracutaneous manifestations such as Lyme neuroborreliosis. Metabolic biosignatures of patients with early Lyme disease can potentially provide diagnostic targets, as well as highlight metabolic pathways that contribute to pathogenesis. Sera from well-characterized patients diagnosed with either early localized Lyme disease (ELL) or early disseminated Lyme disease (EDL), plus healthy individuals (HC), from the United States were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Comparative analyses were performed between ELL, or EDL, or ELL combined with EDL, and the HC to develop biosignatures present in early Lyme disease. A direct comparison between ELL and EDL was also performed to develop a biosignature for stages of early Lyme disease. Metabolic pathway analysis and chemical identification of metabolites with LC-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS\/MS) demonstrated alterations of eicosanoid, bile acid, sphingolipid, glycerophospholipid, and acylcarnitine metabolic pathways during early Lyme disease . These metabolic alterations were confirmed using a separate set of serum samples for validation. The findings demonstrated the metabolic pathways altered in the host during early Lyme disease and provide evidence that the diversity in the type of early Lyme disease manifestations may be associated with particular metabolic alterations.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"1101":{"study_id":"ST001224","study_title":"Vaginal swab lipidome profiles at 48 h reflect the fat composition of neonatal diet during first two days postnatal","study_type":"MRM-profiling","institute":"Purdue University","department":"Animal Sciences","last_name":"Ferreira","first_name":"Christina","email":"cferrei@purdue.edu","phone":"7654095924","submit_date":"2019-06-06","study_summary":"In this study, we further investigated the efficacy of using MRM-profiling of vaginal lipids to differentiate PND 2 vaginal swabs between gilts suckled by sow or fed milk replacer.

Escherichia coli epitomizes these obstacles: this Gram-negative bacterial species is the most prevalent agent of UTIs worldwide and can also colonize the urogenital tract in a phenomenon known as asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB). Unfortunately, at the level of the organism, the relationship between symptomatic UTI and ASB is poorly defined, confounding our understanding of microbial pathogenesis and strategies for clinical management. Unlike diarrheagenic pathotypes of E. coli, the definition of uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) remains phenomenologic, without conserved phenotypes and (known) genetic determinants that rigorously distinguish UTI- and ASB-associated strains. This manuscript provides a cross-disciplinary review of the current issues \u2013 from interrelated mechanistic and diagnostic perspectives \u2013 and describes new opportunities by which clinical resources can be leveraged to overcome molecular challenges. Specifically, we present our work harnessing a large collection of patient-derived isolates to identify features that do (and do not) distinguish UTI- from ASB-associated E. coli strains. Analyses of biofilm formation, previously reported to be higher in ASB strains, revealed extensive phenotypic heterogeneity that did not correlate with symptomatology. However, metabolomic experiments revealed distinct signatures between ASB and cystitis isolates, including species in the purine pathway (previously shown to be critical for intracellular survival during acute infection). Together, these studies demonstrate how large-scale, wild-type approaches can help dissect the physiology of colonization-versus-infection, suggesting that the molecular definition of UPEC may rest at the level of global bacterial metabolism.","subject_species":"Escherichia coli"},"1120":{"study_id":"ST001245","study_title":"Luteal lipids regulate progesterone production and may modulate immune cell function during the estrous cycle and pregnancy","study_type":"","institute":"University of California, Davis","department":"Genome and Biomedical Sciences Facility","last_name":"Fiehn","first_name":"Oliver","email":"ofiehn@ucdavis.edu","phone":"(530) 754-8258","submit_date":"2019-07-29","study_summary":"Despite data indicating an important functional role for bioactive lipids in luteal function, little is known about the patterns of abundance of these lipids in corpus luteum (CL) during luteal development, maintenance, and rescue, in any species.

Fatty acid challenged MiMaC treated HADHA mutant cardiomyocytes manifested the disease phenotype: defective calcium dynamics and repolarization kinetics which resulted in a pro-arrhythmic state. Single cell RNA-seq revealed a novel cardiomyocyte developmental intermediate, based on metabolic gene expression. This intermediate gave rise to mature-like cardiomyocytes in control cells but, mutant cells transitioned to a pathological state with reduced fatty acid beta-oxidation (FAO), reduced mitochondrial proton gradient, disrupted cristae structure and defective cardiolipin remodeling.

Additionally, the KI showed an altered eicosanoid profile of reduced pro-inflammatory prostaglandins (PGE2) and increased levels of specific HETE species (5-HETE). Elevated 5-HETE levels promoted increased dermal fibroblast migration and collagen deposition. This \u201cgain of function\u201d role for the mutant cPLA2 was also linked to differential cellular localization of cPLA2\u03b1 and 5-HETE biosynthetic factors. These studies demonstrate regulation of key biological mechanisms by a defined protein:lipid interaction in vivo and provide new insights into cPLA2 function.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"1130":{"study_id":"ST001255","study_title":"Immunomodulatory activity of hyaluronidase is associated with metabolic adaptations during acute inflammation","study_type":"","institute":"Sao Paulo University","department":"School of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Ribeirao Preto","last_name":"Gardinassi","first_name":"Luiz Gustavo","email":"gustavogardinassi@usp.br","phone":"551633154189","submit_date":"2019-09-26","study_summary":"Objective and design: Investigate survival outcomes, and immunological and metabolomic effects of hyaluronidase (Hz) treatment during mouse models of acute inflammation and sepsis. Methods: Survival of C57Bl\/6 mice was monitored after lethal challenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or cecal and ligation puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis and treated with Hz or saline. Mice were also challenged with LPS and treated with Hz for leukocyte counting, cytokine quantification and determination of metabolomic profiles in the peritoneal fluid. Results: Hz treatment improved survival outcomes after lethal challenge with LPS or CLPinduced sepsis. LPS challenge promoted acute neutrophil accumulation and production of interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and IL-6 in the peritoneum, whereas Hz treatment suppressed neutrophil infiltration and cytokine production. We further characterized the metabolomic alterations caused by LPS challenge, which predicted activity of metabolic pathways related to fatty acids and eicosanoids. Hz treatment had a profound effect over the metabolic response, reflected by reductions of the relative levels of fatty acids. Conclusion: Collectively, these data demonstrate that Hz treatment is associated with metabolic reprogramming of pathways that sustain the inflammatory response.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"1131":{"study_id":"ST001256","study_title":"Metabolic landscape remodeling in dystrophic muscle through glucocorticoid steroid regimens","study_type":"","institute":"Northwestern University","department":"","last_name":"Quattrocelli","first_name":"Mattia","email":"mattia.quattrocelli@northwestern.edu","phone":"3125037450","submit_date":"2019-09-26","study_summary":"Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by genetic defects in the gene encoding dystrophin and leads to progressive muscle degeneration.

Despite recent advances in T2D research, the etiology of this disease and the mechanisms underlying the metabolic defects remain poorly understood. While obesity is thought to be the main cause for the rising prevalence of T2D, obesity alone cannot explain differences in the trends of T2D among different geographical regions and populations. Growing evidence suggests that environmental exposures to toxic and diabetogenic substances must play important roles. Inorganic arsenic (iAs) is a naturally occurring toxic metalloid. Hundreds of millions of people worldwide are exposed to unsafe levels of iAs in drinking water and food. iAs is a potent carcinogen, but iAs exposure has also been linked to increase risk of T2D. While the link between iAs exposure and T2D is well-established, the mechanisms underlying the diabetogenic effects of iAs exposure remain unclear. Results of our previously published and ongoing studies suggest that pancreatic \u03b2-cells are a primary target for iAs and its metabolites and that impaired insulin secretion by \u03b2-cells is the mechanism by which iAs exposure leads to diabetes. The proposed project will use metabolomics to identify metabolic pathways in \u03b2-cells that are targeted by iAs and its metabolites, monomethyl-As (MAs) and dimethyl-As (DMAs). The metabolomics data combined with results of our ongoing mechanistic studies will provide a comprehensive picture of the metabolic dysfunction leading to the development of diabetes in individuals exposed to iAs and of the molecular mechanisms that underlie this dysfunction. Identifying the affected pathways and mechanisms will ultimately help to improve strategies for prevention and\/or treatment of T2D associated with chronic exposure to iAs.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"1142":{"study_id":"ST001267","study_title":"Mass spectrometry-based lipidomics of oral squamous cell carcinoma tissue reveals aberrant cholesterol and glycerophospholipid metabolism","study_type":"Case study","institute":"University of Helsinki","department":"Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Cancer","last_name":"Sil\u00e9n","first_name":"Suvi","email":"Suvi.silen@helsinki.fi","phone":"NA","submit_date":"2019-10-09","study_summary":"Comparison between the lipid profile in oral squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue and healthy epithelial tissue from the contralateral side of the tongue of the same patient.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"1143":{"study_id":"ST001268","study_title":"Metabolome data to annotate metabolite origins","study_type":"","institute":"University of Colorado Denver","department":"Anschutz Medical Campus","last_name":"Reisdorph","first_name":"Nichole","email":"nichole.reisdorph@ucdenver.edu","phone":"3037249234","submit_date":"2019-10-22","study_summary":"Plasma metabolomics from HIV subjects and controls was incorporated with microbiome data to develop Annotation of Metabolite Origins via Networks (AMON).","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"1144":{"study_id":"ST001269","study_title":"Exosomal lipids for classifying early and late stage non-small cell lung cancer","study_type":"Biomarker Discovery","institute":"University of Kentucky","department":"Center for Environmental and Systems Biochemistry","last_name":"Thompson","first_name":"Patrick","email":"ptth222@uky.edu, rick.higashi@uky.edu","phone":"8592181027","submit_date":"2019-10-17","study_summary":"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Patients with early stage lung cancer have the best prognosis with surgical removal of the tumor, but the disease is often asymptomatic until advanced disease develops, and there are no effective blood-based screening methods for early detection of lung cancer in at-risk populations. We have explored the lipid profiles of blood plasma exosomes using ultra high-resolution Fourier transform mass spectrometry (UHR-FTMS) for early detection of the prevalent non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). Exosomes are nanovehicles released by various cells and tumor tissues to elicit important biofunctions such as immune modulation and tumor development. Plasma exosomal lipid profiles were acquired from 39 normal and 91 NSCLC subjects (44 early stage and 47 late stage). We have applied two multivariate statistical methods, Random Forest (RF) and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) to classify the data. For the RF method, the Gini importance of the assigned lipids was calculated to select 16 lipids with top importance. Using the LASSO method, 7 features were selected based on a grouped LASSO penalty. The Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve for early and late stage cancer versus normal subjects using the selected lipid features was 0.85 and 0.88 for RF and 0.79 and 0.77 for LASSO, respectively. These results show the value of RF and LASSO for metabolomics data-based biomarker development, which provide robust an independent classifiers with sparse data sets.

Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta of the brain as well as degeneration of motor and non-motor circuitry. The cause of neuronal death is currently unknown, although chronic neuroinflammation, aggregated \u03b1-synuclein, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress have all been implicated. Gliosis has been shown to exacerbate neuroinflammation via secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and there is a subsequent infiltration of T lymphocytes (T-cells), into the brain of PD patients. Using liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS), we have observed metabolomic changes in stool samples, thought to be associated with the potential disease-modifying effect of an immunotherapy administered to transgenic Parkinsonian (A53T) mice. Significant elevations (p<0.05) in metabolites associated with immune response (taurine, histamine and its methylated product, 3-methylhistamine) are identified as being higher in the mice undergoing immunotherapy. Furthermore, a reduction in triacylglycerols (TG) and diacylglyceols (DG) expression in stool following immunotherapy suggests a regulation of lipid breakdown or biosynthesis with the vaccine.

The CL is known for the prominent presence of intracellular lipid droplets (LDs). However relatively little is known about the composition and function of these luteal LDs. Our objective was to identify the lipid composition of LDs from fully functional bovine CLs. Luteal LDs were isolated by flotation through a discontinuous sucrose gradient, lipids were then extracted using a standard Bligh and Dyer protocol, dried, and sent to Avanti Polar Lipids for lipidomics analysis. The samples were provided for lipidomic profiling of free sterols, cholesteryl esters, triglycerides, diacylglycerols, phospholipids, and sphingolipids. Molecular species were resolved by reversed-phase liquid chromatography in the presence of class and sub-class specific internal standard compounds added to each sample. The compounds were detected by tandem mass spectrometry (MS\/MS) with scheduled multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) for mass-specific fragment ions according to the lipid class and molecular weight of the compound. Quantification of cholesterol, cholesteryl esters, triglycerides, and diglycerides were directly calculated with standards and internal standards from calibration response curves. The remaining lipid species were semi-quantization using the integrated area of each analyte\u2019s MRM peak, divided by the appropriate internal standard peak area, and multiplied by the standard\u2019s known concentration. Lipid concentrations were normalized to the corresponding protein concentration of each sample and as a mol % relative to total lipids or within each lipid class. Isolated luteal LDs were composed primarily of triglyceride (88%, mol% of lipid class to total lipids). Other neutral lipids included diacylglycerol, 2.9%; and cholesteryl esters, 1.5%. Polar lipids were primarily composed of phosphatidylcholine (3.1%), sphingomyelin (1.5%), phosphatidylinositol (0.9%), phosphatidylethanolamine (0.8%) and phosphatidylserine (0.4%). A number of other minor lipids representing less than 0.32% of the total lipid pool were also detected including phosphatidylglycerol, lysophospholipids, ceramides, and glycosylated ceramides.

Detailed insight into lipid function requires knowledge of the subcellular localization of individual lipids. We report an analysis of the subcellular lipidome of the mammalian macrophage, a cell type that plays key roles in inflammation, immune responses, and phagocytosis. Nuclei, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), plasmalemma, and cytoplasm were isolated from RAW 264.7 macrophages in basal and activated states. Subsequent lipidomic analyses of major membrane lipid categories identified 229 individual\/isobaric species, including 163 glycerophospholipids, 48 sphingolipids, 13 sterols, and 5 prenols. Major subcellular compartments exhibited substantially divergent glycerophospholipid profiles. Activation of macrophages by the Toll-like receptor 4-specific lipopolysaccharide Kdo2-lipid A caused significant remodeling of the subcellular lipidome. Some changes in lipid composition occurred in all compartments (e.g. increases in the levels of ceramides and the cholesterol precursors desmosterol and lanosterol). Other changes were manifest in specific organelles. For example, oxidized sterols increased and unsaturated cardiolipins decreased in mitochondria, whereas unsaturated ether-linked phosphatidylethanolamines decreased in the ER. We speculate that these changes may reflect mitochondrial oxidative stress and the release of arachidonic acid from the ER in response to cell activation.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"1164":{"study_id":"ST001289","study_title":"Regulated accumulation of desmosterol integrates macrophage lipid metabolism and inflammatory responses","study_type":"","institute":"LIPID MAPS","department":"Multiple","last_name":"Fahy","first_name":"Eoin","email":"efahy@ucsd.edu","phone":"858-534-4076","submit_date":"2019-12-17","study_summary":"To investigate the relationship between hypercholesterolemia, foam cell formation and inflammation, we performed lipidomic and transcriptomic analyses of elicited peritoneal macrophages in wild type (WT) or LDL receptor knockout (LDLR KO) mice fed either a normal cholesterol, normal fat (NCNF) diet or a high cholesterol, high fat (HCHF) 'Western' style diet. The combination of the LDLR KO genotype and the HCHF diet results in the formation of macrophage foam cells in the elicited peritoneal macrophage population. Analysis of macrophages from the above four experimental groups revealed massive reprogramming of the lipidome in response to both diet and genotype. These studies confirmed and extended prior knowledge regarding the roles of SREBP and LXR signaling in cholesterol and fatty acid homeostasis. Unexpectedly, peritoneal macrophage foam cells exhibited a strongly 'deactivated' phenotype, with marked suppression of pro-inflammatory mediators that are normally characteristic of the inflammatory responses associated with atherosclerotic lesions. Many of these changes in gene expression and lipid metabolism appear to be related to the paradoxical accumulation of high levels of desmosterol, the last intermediate in the Bloch pathway of cholesterol biosynthesis. WT or LDLR KO mice were fed either a NCNF diet or a HCHF diet for twelve weeks to establish four experimental groups (WT-NCNF diet, WT-HCHF diet, KO-NCNF diet, and KO-HCHF diet). As expected, the combination of the HCHF diet and LDLR KO genotype resulted in a synergistic effect on serum lipid levels. Elicited peritoneal macrophages (92-96% F4\/80-positive) were immediately prepared for analysis, thereby preserving in vivo gene expression and lipid profiles. Macrophages derived from LDLR KO mice fed the HCHF diet contained nearly four-fold more total cholesterol than cells from WT mice fed the same diet. Quantitative analysis of 245 lipid species revealed significant changes in nearly all major lipid classes. Using a two-way ANOVA model, we found that 176 (72%) of the lipids analyzed were significantly affected by the HCHF diet, 133 (54%) by the LDLR KO genotype, and 114 (46%) by interactions between the HCHF diet and LDLR KO genotype. Many of the observed interactions (60%) were synergistic.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"1165":{"study_id":"ST001290","study_title":"Lipidome Signatures of Metastasis in a Transgenic Mouse Model of Sonic Hedgehog Medulloblastoma.","study_type":"Untargeted metabolomics","institute":"Georgia Institute of Technology","department":"Chemistry","last_name":"Huang","first_name":"Danning","email":"dhuang74@gatech.edu","phone":"4045127523","submit_date":"2019-12-13","study_summary":"Metabolic alternations were investigated by applying Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-MS) to mice brain tissue samples collected from SmoA1-Math-GFP mice with (n=18) and without (n=7) metastasis.

In filberts (Corylus sp.), chelated iron promotes the growth of new shoots but the mechanism(s) are not understood. Objectives: To use untargeted metabolomics and hormonomics approaches to generate novel hypotheses for the morphoregulatory role of ferric ethylenediamine-N,N'-di-(ortho-hydroxyphenyl) acetic acid (Fe-EDDHA) in filbert shoot organogenesis in vitro. Methods: Data were generated using previously optimized standardized untargeted metabolomics protocols with time of flight mass spectrometry. Multivariate statistical tools (principal component and partial least squares discriminant analysis) did not detect significant differences. Discovery tools Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM), multiple linear regression analysis, Bayesian analysis, logical algorithms, machine learning, synthetic biotransformations, targeted hormonomics, and online resources including MetaboAnalyst were used. Results: Starch\/sucrose metabolism and shikimate pathway metabolites were increased. Dose dependent decreases were found in polyphenol metabolism, specifically ellagic acid and its methylated derivative 3,4,3'-tri-O-methylellagic acid. Hormonomics analysis revealed significant differences in phytohormones and their conjugates. FeEDDHA treatment reduced indole-3-acetic acid, abscisic acid, salicylic acid, jasmonic acid conjugates (JA-Trp, JA-Ile, OH-JA) and dihydrozeatinglucoside in regenerating explants. Serotonin (5HT) was decreased in FeEDDHA-treated regenerating tissues while the related metabolite melatonin was increased. Eight phenolic conjugates of 5HT and eight catabolites were affected by FeEDDHA indicating that metabolism to sequester, deactivate and metabolize 5HT was induced by Fe(III). Tryptophan was metabolized through kynurenine but not anthranilate. Conclusion: Seven novel hypotheses were generated to guide future studies to understand the regulatory control(s) of shoot organogenesis.","subject_species":"Corylus avellana;Corylus americana"},"1172":{"study_id":"ST001297","study_title":"High Cellulose diet impact on gut inflammation","study_type":"","institute":"Asan Medical Center","department":"","last_name":"Yoo","first_name":"Hyun Ju","email":"yoohyunju@amc.seoul.kr","phone":"82-02-3010-4029","submit_date":"2019-12-30","study_summary":"Dietary cellulose prevents gut inflammation by modulating lipid metabolism and gut microbiota","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"1173":{"study_id":"ST001298","study_title":"Metabolome Profiling of Synechococcus elongatus PCC 11801 strains engineered for Succinate Production","study_type":"Measurement of relative metabolite pools of wild type and engineered Synechococcus elongatus PCC 11801 strains using Isotopic Ratio Method","institute":"Indian Institute of Technology Bombay","department":"Department of Chemical Engineering","last_name":"Wangikar","first_name":"Pramod P","email":"wangikar@iitb.ac.in","phone":"22254215","submit_date":"2020-01-03","study_summary":"Experiments to measure relative metabolite pools of wild type Synechococcus elongatus PCC 11801 and its recombinants producing succinate.

To obtain a global and integrative picture of the role of distinct sub-cellular acetyl-CoA pools, we measured the acetylome, transcriptome, proteome and metabolome of parasites lacking ACL\/ACS or BCKDH. Loss of ACL\/ACS results in the hypo-acetylation of nucleo-cytosolic and secretory proteins, alters gene expression broadly and is required for the synthesis of parasite-specific FAs.

The data supported the conclusion that metabolic changes in a ridA mutant were due to the IlvA-dependent generation of 2AA, and that the majority of these changes were a consequence of damage to GlyA. While many of the shifts in the metabolome of a ridA mutant could be explained, changes in some metabolites were not easily modeled, suggesting that additional levels of metabolic complexity remain to be unraveled.","subject_species":"Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium"},"1184":{"study_id":"ST001309","study_title":"Metabolite expression in liver after early life exposure to an endocrine disruptor at 240 days postnatal (part-I)","study_type":"Metabolite expression after chemical exposure versus control.","institute":"Baylor College of Medicine","department":"Molecular and Cellular Biology","last_name":"Walker","first_name":"Cheryl","email":"Cheryl.walker@bcm.edu","phone":"713-798-8219","submit_date":"2020-01-27","study_summary":"Our early-life environment has a profound influence on developing organs that impact metabolic function and determines disease susceptibility across the life-course.

To understand how BPA and the reputedly more inert bisphenol S (BPS) affect the placenta, C57BL6J mouse dams were fed 200 \u03bcg\/kg body weight BPA or BPS daily for 2 wk and then bred. They continued to receive these chemicals until embryonic day 12.5, whereupon placental samples were collected and compared with unexposed controls. BPA and BPS altered the expression of an identical set of 13 genes. Both exposures led to a decrease in the area occupied by spongiotrophoblast relative to multinucleated giant cells (GCs) within the junctional zone, markedly reduced placental serotonin (5-HT) concentrations, and lowered 5-HT GC immunoreactivity. Concentrations of dopamine and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, the main metabolite of serotonin, were increased. GC dopamine immunoreactivity was increased in BPA- and BPS-exposed placentas. A strong positive correlation between 5-HT+ GCs and reductions in spongiotrophoblast to GC area suggests that this neurotransmitter is essential for maintaining cells within the junctional zone. In contrast, an inverse correlation existed between dopamine+ GCs and reductions spongiotrophoblast to GC area. These outcomes lead to the following conclusions. First, BPS exposure causes almost identical placental effects as BPA. Second, a major target of BPA\/BPS is either spongiotrophoblast or GC within the junctional zone. Third, imbalances in neurotransmitter-positive GC and an observed decrease in docosahexaenoic acid and estradiol, also occurring in response to BPA\/BPS exposure, likely affect the placental\u2013brain axis of the developing mouse fetus.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"1186":{"study_id":"ST001311","study_title":"Lipid expression in liver after early lifer exposure to an endocrine disruptor at 70 days postnatal (part-II)","study_type":"Lipid expression after chemical exposure versus control","institute":"Baylor College of Medicine","department":"","last_name":"Walker","first_name":"Cheryl","email":"Cheryl.walker@bcm.edu","phone":"713-798-8219","submit_date":"2020-01-24","study_summary":"Our early-life environment has a profound influence on developing organs that impact metabolic function and determines disease susceptibility across the life-course.

Despite recent advances in T2D research, the etiology of this disease and the mechanisms underlying the metabolic defects remain poorly understood. While obesity is thought to be the main cause for the rising prevalence of T2D, obesity alone cannot explain differences in the trends of T2D among different geographical regions and populations. Growing evidence suggests that environmental exposures to toxic and diabetogenic substances must play important roles. Inorganic arsenic (iAs) is a naturally occurring toxic metalloid. Hundreds of millions of people worldwide are exposed to unsafe levels of iAs in drinking water and food. iAs is a potent carcinogen, but iAs exposure has also been linked to increase risk of T2D. While the link between iAs exposure and T2D is well-established, the mechanisms underlying the diabetogenic effects of iAs exposure remain unclear. Results of our previously published and ongoing studies suggest that pancreatic islets are a primary target for iAs and its metabolites and that impaired insulin secretion by islets is the mechanism by which iAs exposure leads to diabetes. The proposed project will use metabolomics to identify metabolic pathways in \u03b2-cells that are targeted by iAs and its metabolites, monomethyl-As (MAs) and dimethyl-As (DMAs). The metabolomics data combined with results of our ongoing mechanistic studies will provide a comprehensive picture of the metabolic dysfunction leading to the development of diabetes in individuals exposed to iAs and of the molecular mechanisms that underlie this dysfunction. Identifying the affected pathways and mechanisms will ultimately help to improve strategies for prevention and\/or treatment of T2D associated with chronic exposure to iAs.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"1190":{"study_id":"ST001315","study_title":"Retargeting azithromycin-like compounds as antimalarials with dual modality","study_type":"","institute":"Monash University","department":"","last_name":"Siddiqui","first_name":"Ghizal","email":"ghizal.siddiqui@monash.edu","phone":"99039282","submit_date":"2020-02-06","study_summary":"Resistance to front-line antimalarials (artemisinin combination therapies) is spreading, and development of new drug treatment strategies to rapidly kill Plasmodium parasites that cause malaria are urgently needed. Here, we show that azithromycin\u2014a clinically used macrolide antibiotic that targets the bacterium-like ribosome of the malaria parasites apicoplast organelle and causes a slow-killing \u2018delayed death\u2019 phenotype\u2014can also rapidly kill parasites throughout the asexual blood-stages of the lifecycle via a \u2018quick-killing\u2019 mechanism of action. Investigation of 84 azithromycin analogues revealed nanomolar quick-killing potency that is directed against the very earliest stage of parasite development within red blood cells. Indeed, the best analogue exhibited 1600-fold higher potency than azithromycin for in vitro treatment windows less than 48 hours. Analogues were also effective against the zoonotic malaria parasite P. knowlesi, and against both multi-drug and artemisinin resistant P. falciparum lines. Metabolomic profiles of azithromycin analogue treated parasites were similar to those of chloroquine treated parasites, suggesting that the quick-killing mechanism of action may in part be localised to the parasite food vacuole. However, metabolomic signatures associated with mitochondrial disruption were also present. In addition, unlike chloroquine, azithromycin and analogues were active across blood stage development, including merozoite invasion, suggesting that these macrolides have a multi-factorial mechanism of quick-killing activity. The positioning of functional groups added to azithromycin and its quick-killing analogues altered their activity against bacterial-like ribosomes but had minimal change on quick-killing activity, which suggests that apicoplast-targeting, delayed-death activity can either be preserved or removed independently of quick-killing. Apicoplast minus parasites remained susceptible to both azithromycin and its analogues, further demonstrating that quick-killing is independent of apicoplast-targeting, delayed-death activity. Therefore, development of azithromycin and analogues as antimalarials offers the possibility of targeting parasites through both a quick-killing and delayed death mechanism of action in a single, multifactorial chemotype.","subject_species":"Plasmodium falciparum"},"1191":{"study_id":"ST001316","study_title":"Time-course experiment of Microchloropsis gaditana cells supplemented with CO2","study_type":"Time-course experiment","institute":"International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology","department":"Integrative Biology","last_name":"Jutur","first_name":"Pannaga Pavan","email":"jppavan@icgeb.res.in","phone":"+91 11 26741358","submit_date":"2020-02-04","study_summary":"Experiments were conducted with Microchloropsis gaditana supplemented with very-low CO2 and high CO2.

Metabolomic analysis revealed that both NMN and the Combined treatment increased nicotinamide and 1-methylnicotinamide levels, indicating greater NAD+ turnover, but only the Combined treatment resulted in significantly greater steady state NAD(H) levels. A novel magnetic resonance approach was used to assess how metabolite levels responded to changing workload.

While the necroptosis program relies on activation of RIP1, RIP3 kinases and MLKL, ferroptotic death is triggered by 15- Lipoxygenase (15LO) catalyzed oxidation of arachidonoyl- (AA) or adrenoyl- (AdA) phosphatidylethanolamines (PE) controlled by the phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 1 (PEBP1). PEBP1 displays \u201cregulatory\u201d promiscuity towards multiple protein partners, including RAF1 kinase. Given a distinct structural homology between RAF1 kinase and RIP3 kinase, we hypothesized that PEBP1 may interact with RIP3 and act as a switch from necroptosis to ferroptosis. Using computational, genetic and redox lipidomics approaches, we show that PEBP1 liberated from RAF1 kinase binds and sterically inhibits RIP3 thus turning-off necroptosis. Highly expressed 15LO may outcompete and bind PEBP1 to promote AA-PE\/AdA-PE oxidation and ferroptosis.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) metabolomics is a quantitative and reproducible method for the determination of bacterial response to environmental stressors and for visualization of perturbations to biochemical pathways. NMR metabolomics is used to elucidate metabolite differences between wild type and antimicrobially mutated Escherichia coli (E. coli) samples. Proton (1H) NMR hydrophilic metabolite analysis was conducted on samples of E. coli after 33 growth cycles of a minimum inhibitory challenge to E. coli by poly(amidoamine) dendrimers functionalized with mannose and with C16-DABCO quaternary ammonium endgroups and compared to the metabolic profile of wild type E. coli. The wild type and mutated E. coli samples were separated into distinct sample sets by hierarchical clustering, principal component analysis (PCA) and sparse partial least squares discriminate analysis (sPLS-DA). Metabolite components of membrane fortification and energy related pathways had a significant p-value and fold change between the wild type and mutated E. coli. Amino acids commonly associated with membrane fortification from cationic antimicrobials, such as lysine, were found to have a higher concentration in the mutated E. coli than the wild type E. coli. N-acetylglucosamine, a major component of peptidoglycan synthesis, was found to have a 25 fold higher concentration in the mid log phase of the mutated E. coli than the mid log phase of the wild type.The metabolic profile suggests that E. coli change their peptidoglycan composition in order to garner protection from the highly positively charged and multivalent C16-DABCO and mannose functionalized dendrimer.","subject_species":"Escherichia coli"},"1226":{"study_id":"ST001353","study_title":"Untargeted metabolomics in skeletal muscle of mice with chronic kidney disease","study_type":"MS quantitative analysis","institute":"University of Florida","department":"","last_name":"Ryan","first_name":"Terence","email":"ryant@ufl.edu","phone":"352-294-1700","submit_date":"2020-04-02","study_summary":"This study performed untargeted metabolomics analysis of skeletal muscle obtained form mice with and without chronic kidney disease.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"1227":{"study_id":"ST001354","study_title":"48 hours post-treatment L-Carnitine Pharmacometabolomics in Sepsis (CaPS) Patients","study_type":"multiple timepoints; patients with severe sepsis or septic shock treated with varying doses of L-carnitine or a saline placebo","institute":"University of Michigan","department":"Clinical Pharmacy","last_name":"McHugh","first_name":"Cora","email":"NMRmetabolomics@umich.edu","phone":"7343530164","submit_date":"2020-04-09","study_summary":"phase II study of L-carnitine infusion for the treatment of vasopressor-dependent shock","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"1228":{"study_id":"ST001355","study_title":"Influence of propylparaben in children","study_type":"","institute":"Seoul National University College of Medicine and Hospital","department":"Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics","last_name":"Lee","first_name":"Yujin","email":"yoojinlee@snu.ac.kr","phone":"+821033804686","submit_date":"2020-03-28","study_summary":"Exposure to paraben was associated with allergic outcomes, partially through the metabolomics changes.

Metabolites are the direct product of metabolic activity; they are therefore expected to both reflect and influence the daily cycle of the microbial community. Here we measure the intracellular metabolome of the microbial community of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, sampled at 4-hour intervals for 8 days. Concentrations of some metabolites common to many organisms exhibit diel periodicity, revealing synchrony of community-level metabolism. Comparing these data to gene expression data reveals temporal offsets between gene transcription and cellular activity, and ties some metabolites to the activities of specific organisms. For example, the dramatic fluctuations of the disaccharide trehalose likely reflect the daily cycles of {Crocosphaera}, a photosynthesizing cyanobacteria that needs to store energy during the day to fuel nighttime nitrogen-fixation. This study illustrates how pairing multiple types of 'omics and environmental data can provide insight into how the activities of individual organisms lead to community functions such as net primary productivity and nitrogen fixation.","subject_species":"Ilyonectria mors-panacis;Ilyonectria rufa;Ilyonectria robusta;Ilyonectria torresensis;Ilyonectria estremocensis;Neonectria obtusispora"},"1230":{"study_id":"ST001357","study_title":"Longitudinal wastewater sampling and untargeted metabolomics of three buildings","study_type":"","institute":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology","department":"","last_name":"ethan","first_name":"evans","email":"eevans@mit.edu","phone":"617-253-2726","submit_date":"2020-03-20","study_summary":"Direct sampling of building wastewater has the potential to enable precision public health observations and interventions.

Internal to a building, numerous and seemingly unrelated features, with mz and rt differences up to hundreds of Daltons and seconds, display highly correlated fTDs, suggesting non-obvious feature relationships. Data-driven building classification achieves high sensitivity and specificity, and extracts building-identifying features found to possess unique dynamics.

At any point in time, the difference between these two processes yields a carbon pool in surface particles that is a combination of both freshly fixed and partially degraded material. On a molecular level, we have a limited knowledge of the small molecules, or metabolites, within this pool. Specific metabolites have been shown to be responsible for fueling respiration, maintaining organismal interactions, and transferring energy throughout the microbial community. Metabolomics, or the direct observation and quantification of the small molecules that are the result of cellular activity, provides an important lens through which we can begin to assess the standing stocks of small compounds that likely fuel a great deal of heterotrophic activity in the surface ocean. Here we describe community metabolomes of particulate material into the North Pacific Ocean and compare the metabolomes to a variety of phytoplankton grown in the lab. Using both targeted and untargeted metabolomics, we identify metabolites in the particulate carbon pool and explore their latitudinal and phylogenetic distributions. This analysis reveals several compounds that have not been previously recognized as abundant components of the marine organic carbon pool. We found that the community metabolome showed distinct differences between the regimes that likely reflects the phytoplankton community present. The community metabolome in surface waters of the subtropical domain was remarkably consistent even when sampled weeks apart, while the northern regions showed a patichier and less reproducible community metabolome. Some individual compounds showed distinct patterns between oceanographic regimes, including homarine, an abundant molecule that can contribute up to 4\\% of the total particulate carbon pool in marine surface waters. Glutamic acid and glutamine showed opposite patterns in the oceanographic regimes, suggesting differences in community-level nitrogen assimilation in these different regimes. Overall, this study offers a new perspective into particulate carbon composition in oceanographic research, reveals important carbon pools that may fuel the microbial loop, and suggests an altered community-level nitrogen assimilation capacity over the North Pacific transition zone.","subject_species":"Natural mixed marine microbial community"},"1245":{"study_id":"ST001373","study_title":"Targeting Sirt2 reprograms T cell metabolism for effective immune response","study_type":"Targeted Metabolomics","institute":"Moffitt Cancer Center","department":"Immunology","last_name":"Koomen","first_name":"John","email":"john.koomen@moffitt.org","phone":"8137458524","submit_date":"2019-07-24","study_summary":"There is a growing evidence that metabolism is a key driver of T cell functions. A switch from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis is a hallmark of T cell activation and is required to meet metabolic demands of proliferation and effector functions.

Sirt2 is induced upon T cells activation and increases in late maturation stages. Sirt2 negatively regulates glycolysis by targeting key glycolytic enzymes. Remarkably, Sirt2 knockout T cells exhibit profound upregulation of aerobic glycolysis with enhanced proliferation and effector function and thus effectively reject tumor challenge in vivo. Furthermore pharmacologic inhibition of Sirt2 in human tumor infiltrating lymphocytes demonstrated similar phenotype.

LC-MS based untargeted metabolomics are the main untargeted methods used for juice metabolomics to solve the authentication problem faced in fruit juice industry. Objectives To evaluate the performances of different untargeted metabolomics methods on fruit juices metabolomics and authentication, orange and apple fruit juices were selected for this study. Methods IDA-MS and SWATH-MS based on UHPLC-QTOF were used for the metabolomics and authenticity determination of apple and orange juices, including the lab-made samples of oranges (Citrus sinensis Osb.) from Jiangxi Province, apples (Malus domestica Borkh) from Shandong Province, and different brands of commercial orange and apple juice samples from markets. Results IDA-MS and SWATH-MS could both acquire numerous MS1 features and MS2 information of juice components, while SWATH-MS excels at the acquisition rate of MS2. Distinctive separation between authentic orange juice and not authentic orange juice could be seen from principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis based on both IDA-MS and SWATH-MS. After analysis of variance, fold change analysis and orthogonal projection to latent structures discriminant mode, 53 and 46 potential markers were defined by IDA-MS and SWATH-MS (with 77.4% and 100% MS2 acquisition rate) separately. Subsequently, these potential markers were putatively annotated using general chemical databases with 6 more annotated by SWATH-MS. Furthermore, 7 of the potential markers, l-asparagine, umbelliferone, glucosamine, phlorin, epicatechin, phytosphingosine and chlorogenic acid, were identified with standards. For the consideration of model simplicity, two determined makers (umbelliferone and chlorogenic acid) were selected to construct the DD-SIMCA model in commercial samples because of their good correlation with apple adulteration proportion, and the sensitivity and specificity of the model were 100% and 95%. Conclusion SWATH-MS excels at the MS2 acquisition of juice components and potential markers. This study provides an overall performance comparison between IDA-MS and SWATH-MS, and guidance for the method selection on fruit juice metabolomics and juice authenticity determination.

Buffered-mutants had folding problems in vivo and were differently chaperoned in different metabolic states. Notably, this assistance was dependent upon the metabolites and not on the increase in canonical chaperone machineries. Additionally, we were able to reconstitute the folding assistance afforded by metabolites in vitro and propose that changes in metabolite concentrations have the potential to alter proteostasis. Collectively, we unravel that the metabolite pools are bona fide members of proteostasis and aid in mutational buffering. Given the plasticity in cellular metabolism, we posit that metabolic alterations may play an important role in the positive or negative regulation of proteostasis.","subject_species":"Escherichia coli"},"1255":{"study_id":"ST001383","study_title":"Investigating exposures and health impacts of endocrine disrupting chemicals among inner-city children.","study_type":"Observational study","institute":"University of Michigan","department":"Biomedical Research Core Facilities","last_name":"Kachman","first_name":"Maureen","email":"mkachman@med.umich.edu","phone":"734-232-0842","submit_date":"2020-03-18","study_summary":"Our CHEAR project will conduct untargeted metabolomics analyses among children with and without asthma to gain insight into potential mechanisms related to asthma development.

How P. falciparum bridges two transmission seasons months apart, without being cleared by the host or compromising host survival is poorly understood. Here we show that low levels of P. falciparum parasites persist in the blood of asymptomatic Malian individuals during the 5- to 6-month dry season, rarely causing symptoms and minimally affecting the host immune response. Parasites isolated during the dry season are transcriptionally distinct from those of subjects with febrile malaria in the transmission season, reflecting longer circulation within each replicative cycle, of parasitized erythrocytes without adhering to the vascular endothelium. Low parasite levels during the dry season are not due to impaired replication, but rather increased splenic clearance of longer-circulating infected erythrocytes. We propose that P. falciparum virulence in areas of seasonal malaria transmission is regulated so that the parasite decreases its endothelial binding capacity, allowing increased splenic clearance and enabling several months of subclinical parasite persistence.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"1257":{"study_id":"ST001385","study_title":"Microbial and metabolic variations mediate the influence of childhood and adolescent EDC and trace element exposure on breast density.","study_type":"","institute":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai","department":"","last_name":"Petrick","first_name":"Lauren","email":"lauren.petrick@mssm.edu","phone":"212 241 7351","submit_date":"2020-05-22","study_summary":"Our CHEAR project builds on the longitudinal Growth and Obesity Cohort Study in Santiago, Chile, which includes approximately 500 girls born in 2002-2003.

Diabetes\/Metabolism Research and Reviews. Epub 2013 December 15. doi: 10.1002\/dmrr.2510 (PubMed ID: 24339168). Primary metabolites were extracted from 30 \u00b5l plasma aliquots by adding 1 ml of a carefully degassed -20 \u00b0C cold isopropanol\/acetonitrile\/water mixture (3:3:2, v\/v\/v) for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C which simultaneously precipitates proteins. After centrifugation, half of the extract was dried and cleaned up from triglycerides by a 50% acetonitrile mixture. After drying, internal standards were added as C08-C30 fatty acid methyl esters in chloroform as retention index markers (Kind et. al, 2009). Primary metabolites were derivatized by methoximation and trimethylsilylation. Primary metabolites were analyzed by cold injection\/automatic liner exchange gas chromatography time-of- flight mass spectrometry (CIS\/ALEX GC-TOF MS) (Fiehn et. al, 2008). In order to limit buildup of involatile material in the GC system and to prevent any carry over, an automatic liner exchange with multi-baffled liners and cold injection procedures was used instead of classic hot injections into standard s\/sl liners. Multi-baffled inert glass liners were used because classic glass wool liners might hamper derivatization of amino groups for amino acid analysis. Robotic derivatization was further used to control reaction times (Ji et. al, 2011); and GC-columns were employed with integrated 10 meter guard columns, which could cut multiple times in 10 cm increments whenever quality control samples determined out-of-control situations. A temperature of 280 \u00b0C was determined to be the optimum transfer line temperature at which even higher-boiling compounds did not show tailing effects and at which the electron ionization filaments could still be operated at their optimal temperature of 250 \u00b0C and -70 eV. The mass spectrometer was operated using daily mass calibration auto-tuning using FC43 (perfluorotributyl-amine) and acquired 17 spectra per second and 1850-1950 V detector voltage. This high spectral acquisition rate was necessary to obtain enough data for mass spectral deconvolution of co-eluting compounds. Under these conditions, the system was around 10-times more sensitive than classic quadrupole GC-MS instruments and also clearly outperformed GC-triple quadrupole mass spectrometers. For select compounds, even lower limits of detection were achieved than for optimized MRM conditions in UPLC-QTRAP MS analysis. Around 144 unique metabolites were detectable in blood plasma (Fiehn & Kind, 2007); in addition to 221 unidentified compounds that were captured in the BinBase database system and hence, were comparable across studies.

Progress in the field has been stifled by the shortcomings of experimental models which include poor replication of the human condition. To address these challenges, we developed a novel large animal model of systemic infection that is capable of generating high-dimensional clinically relevant data. Methods: Male swine (n=5) were anesthetized, mechanically ventilated, and surgically instrumented for continuous hemodynamic monitoring and serial blood sampling. Animals were inoculated with uropathogenic E. coli by direct injection into the renal parenchyma and were maintained under anesthesia for up to 24 hours. The natural history of the infection was studied, animals were not resuscitated. Multi-dimensional data were collected hourly to every 6 hours; all animals were euthanized when at predetermined physiologic endpoints. Results: Core body temperature progressively increased from mean (SD) 37.9(0.8) \u030aC at baseline to 43.0(1.2) \u030aC at experiment termination (p=0.006). While mean arterial pressure did not begin to decline until 6h post inoculation, dropping from 86(9) mmHg at baseline to 28(5) mmHg (p=0.005) at termination. Blood glucose progressively declined but lactate levels did not elevate until the last hours of the experiment. There were also temporal changes in whole blood concentrations of a number of metabolites including increases in the catecholamine precursors, tyrosine (p=0.005) and phenylalanine (p=0.005). Lung, liver, and kidney function parameters worsened as infection progressed and at study termination there was histopathological evidence of injury in these end-organs. Conclusion: We demonstrate a versatile, multi-dimensional, longitudinal, swine model of systemic infection that could be used to further our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie infection-induced multi-organ dysfunction and failure, optimize resuscitation protocols and test therapeutic interventions. Such a model could improve translation of findings from the bench to the bedside, circumventing a significant obstacle in sepsis research.","subject_species":"Sus scrofa"},"1263":{"study_id":"ST001391","study_title":"Metabolic Response in Patients with Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Symptoms\/Syndrome","study_type":"","institute":"Colorado State University","department":"Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Pathology","last_name":"Belisle","first_name":"John","email":"john.belisle@colostate.edu","phone":"9704915384","submit_date":"2020-05-28","study_summary":"Post-treatment Lyme Disease Symptoms\/Syndrome (PTLDS) occurs in approximately 10% of Lyme disease patients following antibiotic treatment.

Using a targeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics approach, we found that axenic cultures of the Antarctic sea-ice diatom, Nitzschia lecointei, displayed large differences in their metabolomes when grown in a matrix of conditions that included temperatures of \u20131 and 4\u00b0C, and salinities of 32 and 41, despite relatively small changes in growth rate. Temperature exerted a greater effect than salinity on cellular metabolite pool sizes, though the N- or S-containing compatible solutes, 2,3-dihydroxypropane-1-sulfonate (DHPS), glycine betaine (GBT), dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), and proline responded strongly to both temperature and salinity, suggesting complexity in their control. We saw the largest (&gt; 4 fold) response to salinity for proline. DHPS, a rarely studied but potential compatible solute, reached the highest intracellular compatible solute concentrations of ~ 85 mM. When comparing the culture findings to natural Arctic sea-ice diatom communities, we found extensive overlap in metabolite profiles, highlighting the relevance of culture-based studies to probe environmental questions. Large changes in sea-ice diatom metabolomes and compatible solutes over a seasonal cycle could be significant components of biogeochemical cycling within sea ice.","subject_species":"Nitzschia lecointei"},"1265":{"study_id":"ST001394","study_title":"Metabolomic study of Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 and mutants","study_type":"Metabolomics","institute":"IIT Bombay","department":"Department of Chemical Engineering","last_name":"Pal","first_name":"Ankita","email":"pal.ankita90@gmail.com","phone":"08879536816","submit_date":"2020-06-06","study_summary":"Metabolomic analysis of Wildtype, crp mutant and its five adaptively evolved populations evolved in glucose minimal media with 40 mM MOPS during its exponential phase of growth.

Six patient-derived DDLPS cell line models were subject to comprehensive metabolomic (Metabolon) and lipidomic (SCIEX 5600 TripleTOF-MS) profiling to assess associations with MDM2 amplification and their responses to metabolic perturbations. Comparing metabolomic profiles between MDM2 higher and lower amplification cells yielded a total of 23 differentially abundant metabolites across both panels (FDR &lt; 0.05, log2 FC &lt; 0.75), including ceramides, glycosylated ceramides, and sphingomyelins.

In addition, accumulating evidence suggests that both immunity and organismal aging are extremely sex-dimorphic. Here, we describe a multi-omic resource of mouse primary bone marrow neutrophils from young and old female and male animals, at the transcriptomic, metabolomic and lipidomic levels. Importantly, we identify widespread age-related and sex-dimorphic regulation of \u2018omics\u2019 in neutrophils, specifically regulation of chromatin metabolism. We leverage machine-learning and identify candidate molecular drivers of age-related and sex-dimorphic transcriptional regulation of neutrophils.

Few studies, to-date, have investigated how the differences in rich media can influence the volatilome of cultivated bacteria. Objectives: The objective of this study was to determine the influence of rich media composition on the chemical characteristics of the volatilomes of Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis. Methods: S. aureus (ATCC 12600) and S. epidermidis (ATCC 12228) were cultured in triplicate in four rich complex media (BHI, LB, MHB, and TSB), and the volatile metabolites produced by each culture were analyzed using headspace solid-phase microextraction combined with comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography \u2013 time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC\u00d7GC-TOFMS). Results: When comparing the chemical compositions of the staph volatilomes produced in each medium, we observed few differences when the presence versus absence of volatiles were compared. However, when the relative abundances of volatiles were included in the analyses, we observed that culturing staph in media containing free glucose (BHI and TSB) resulted in volatilomes dominated by acids and esters (67%). The low-glucose media (LB and MHB) produced ketones in greatest relative abundances, but the volatilome compositions in these two media were highly dissimilar. Conclusion: The staphylococcal volatilome is strongly influenced by the nutritional composition of the growth medium, especially the availability of free glucose, which is much more evident when the relative abundances of the volatiles are analyzed, compared to the presence versus absence.","subject_species":"Staphylococcus epidermidis"},"1292":{"study_id":"ST001427","study_title":"HPLC-(Q)-TOF-MS based study of plasma metabolic profiles differences associated with age in paediatric population using animal model","study_type":"","institute":"University of the Basque Country","department":"","last_name":"Alboniga","first_name":"Oihane E.","email":"oihaneelena.alboniga@ehu.eus","phone":"0034 946 012 686","submit_date":"2020-07-16","study_summary":"A deep knowledge about the biological development of children is essential for an appropriate drug administration and dosage in paediatrics. Even though the advances made in developmental biology the information available about organ maturation in the early stages of life is limited. This fact, together with the scarcity of clinical trials in children, sometimes leads to the use of off-label drugs. The best approximation to study organ maturation is analysing tissue samples but their collection requires a very invasive method. For this reason, a surrogate matrix such as plasma, which represents a snapshot of global organ\/tissue metabolism, may be a suitable alternative. To test this hypothesis, plasma metabolic profiles from piglets of different ages (newborns, infants, and children) obtained by HPLC-(Q)-TOF-MS at positive and negative ionization modes were here studied. The multiblock principal component analysis used in this work proved to be a useful tool to improve the clustering within groups compared to classical principal component analysis. Furthermore, the separation observed among groups was better resolved by using partial least squares-discriminant analysis, which was validated by bootstrapping and permutation testing. Finally, 27 relevant features in positive and 74 features in negative ionization mode were selected by univariate analysis. Among the significant metabolies, an acylcarnitine and eight glycerophospholipids were annotated. The findings indicate that changes with age in the lipid metabolism, where lysophosphatidylcholine and lysophoshatidylethanolamine are included, might be related with the organ maturation state.","subject_species":"Sus scrofa"},"1293":{"study_id":"ST001428","study_title":"Role of environmental toxicants in modulating disease severity in children with NAFLD","study_type":"","institute":"Emory University","department":"School of Medicine","last_name":"Tran","first_name":"ViLinh","email":"vtran6@emory.edu","phone":"9122281788","submit_date":"2020-07-17","study_summary":"This project aims to further understand about how the environment impacts nonalcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in children.

Previously oral in vitro biofilms grown in saliva have shown proteolytic degradation of salivary proteins and increased extracellular proline. Although arginine and glucose have been shown before to have an effect on oral biofilm growth and activity, there is limited evidence for proline. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to identify extracellular metabolites produced by bacteria in oral biofilms grown on hydroxyapatite discs. Biofilms were inoculated with whole mouth saliva and then grown for 7 days using sterilised whole mouth saliva supplemented with proline, arginine and glucose as a growth-medium. Overall proline had a beneficial effect on biofilm growth \u2013 with significantly fewer dead bacteria present by biomass and surface area of the biofilms (p &lt;0.05). Where arginine and glucose significantly increased and decreased pH, respectively, the pH of proline supplemented biofilms remained neutral at pH 7.3-7.5. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the spent saliva from proline and arginine supplemented biofilms showed inhibition of salivary protein degradation of immature biofilms. NMR analysis of the spent saliva revealed that proline supplemented biofilms were metabolically similar to unsupplemented biofilms, but these biofilms actively metabolised proline to 5-aminopentanoate, butyrate and propionate, and actively utilised glycine. This study shows that in a nutrient limited environment, proline has a beneficial effect on in vitro oral biofilms grown from a saliva inoculum.","subject_species":"Multi-species non-defined biofilm consortium"},"1299":{"study_id":"ST001434","study_title":"Untargeted lipidomics of liver to assess the potential protective role in atherosclerosis progression of A12 antibodies infusion into LDLR-\/-mice","study_type":"LC-MS Untargeted Lipidomics","institute":"Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares Carlos III","department":"","last_name":"Ferrarini","first_name":"Alessia","email":"aferrarini@cnic.es","phone":"+34 914 53 12 00","submit_date":"2020-07-27","study_summary":"In order to assess the therapeutic potential of A12 antibodies in atherosclerosis, untargeted lipidomics of liver samples was performed.

However, comprehensive metrics and methods to evaluate and compare the data quality of global metabolomics data sets are lacking. In this work, we combine newly developed metrics, along with well-known measures, to comprehensively and quantitatively characterize the data quality across two similar LC-MS platforms, with the goal of providing an efficient and improved ability to evaluate the data quality in global metabolite profiling experiments. A pooled human serum sample was run 50 times on two high-resolution LC-QTOF-MS platforms to provide profile and centroid MS data. These data were processed using Progenesis Qi software and then analyzed using five important data quality measures, including retention time drift, compound coverage, missing values and MS reproducibility (2 measures). The coverage was fit to a Gamma distribution versus compound abundance, which was normalized to allow comparison of different platforms. To evaluate missing values, characteristic curves were obtained by plotting the compound detection percentage versus extraction frequency. To characterize reproducibility, the accumulative coefficient of variation (CV) versus percentage of total compounds detected and CV vs intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) were investigated. Key findings include significantly better performance using profile mode data compared to centroid mode as well quantitatively better performance from the newer, higher resolution instrument. A summary of the results given in tabulated form gives a snapshot of the experimental results and provides a template to evaluate the global metabolite profiling workflow. In total, these measures give a good overall view of data quality in global profiling and allow comparisons of data acquisition strategies and platforms as well as optimization of parameters.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"1315":{"study_id":"ST001451","study_title":"Eleostearic acid effects on TAGs and oxLipids","study_type":"","institute":"Fox Chase Cancer Center","department":"","last_name":"Peterson","first_name":"Jeffrey","email":"Jeffrey.peterson@fccc.edu","phone":"215-728-3568","submit_date":"2020-08-20","study_summary":"Quantification of lipid species from cultured human MDA-MB-231 and BT549 cells with or without siRNA knockdown of ACSL1 and treated or not with eleostearic acid","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"1316":{"study_id":"ST001452","study_title":"Targeted metabolomic analysis on hexosamine biosynthetic pathway in flies on time restricted feeding","study_type":"metabolomic identification","institute":"University of California, Davis","department":"Department of Entomology and Nematology","last_name":"Chiu","first_name":"Joanna","email":"jcchiu@ucdavis.edu","phone":"(530) 752-1839","submit_date":"2020-08-13","study_summary":"The integration of circadian and metabolic signals is essential for maintaining robust circadian rhythms and ensuring efficient metabolism and energy use. Using Drosophila as an animal model, we showed observed strong correlation between daily daily rhythms of protein O-linked N-acetylglucosaminylation (O-GlcNAcylation) and clock-controlled feeding-fasting cycles, suggesting that O-GlcNAcylation rhythms are primarily driven by nutrient input. Interestingly, daily O-GlcNAcylation rhythms were severely dampened when we subjected flies to time-restricted feeding (TRF) at unnatural feeding time. This suggests the presence of a clock-regulated buffering mechanism that prevents excessive O-GlcNAcylation at non-optimal times of the day-night cycle, which could disrupt circadian health. We performed targeted metabolomic analysis on hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP), which produces UDP-GlcNAc (the substrate for O-GlcNAcylation), to evaluate the daily activity of HBP enzymes under TRF conditions. We found glutamine--fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT) mediates this buffering mechanism.","subject_species":"Drosophila melanogaster"},"1317":{"study_id":"ST001453","study_title":"Metabolomics of lung injury after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation - Liver ICMS","study_type":"preliminary data","institute":"University of Kentucky","department":"MCC","last_name":"Hildebrandt","first_name":"Gerhard","email":"gerhard.hildebrandt@uky.edu","phone":"800-333-8874","submit_date":"2020-08-21","study_summary":"Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is a potentially curative treatment option for a variety of hematological malignancies.

Cell plate formation involves highly orchestrated vesicle accumulation, fusion, and membrane network maturation supported by the temporary integration of elastic and pliable callose. The small molecule, Endosidin 7 (ES7), arrests late cytokinesis in Arabidopsis by inhibiting callose deposition at the cell plate. Its effect is specific, as it does not broadly affect endomembrane trafficking or cytoskeletal organization. It has emerged as a very valuable tool for dissecting this essential plant process. In order to gain deeper insights regarding its mode of action and the effects of cytokinesis inhibition on overall plant growth, we investigated the effect of ES7 through a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy metabolomics approach. In this case study, profiles of Arabidopsis leaf and root tissues were analyzed at different growth stages and ES7 exposure levels. The results show tissue-specific changes in the plant metabolic profile across a developmental gradient, and the effect that ES7 treatment has on the corresponding metabolome. The ES7 induced profile suggests metabolic compensations in central metabolism pathways in response to cytokinesis inhibition. Further, this study shows that long-term treatment of ES7 disrupts the homeostasis of primary metabolism in Arabidopsis seedlings, likely via alteration of hormonal regulation.","subject_species":"Arabidopsis thaliana"},"1339":{"study_id":"ST001479","study_title":"Metabolomics of Ndufs4 KO brain regions (part - I)","study_type":"","institute":"North-West University","department":"","last_name":"Louw","first_name":"Roan","email":"Roan.Louw@nwu.ac.za","phone":"+27 18 299 4074","submit_date":"2020-09-09","study_summary":"Targeted LC-MS\/MS analysis of amino acids and acylcarnitines in Ndufs4 KO and WT mouse anterior cortex (AC)","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"1340":{"study_id":"ST001480","study_title":"Large diversity in nitrogen- and sulfur-containing compatible solute profiles in polar and temperate diatoms","study_type":"Intracellular metabolites were quantified in diatom species","institute":"University of Washington","department":"Oceanography","last_name":"Dawson","first_name":"Hannah","email":"hmdawson@uw.edu","phone":"206-543-0744","submit_date":"2020-09-09","study_summary":"Intense bottom-ice algal blooms, often dominated by diatoms, are an important source of food for grazers, organic matter for export during sea ice melt, and dissolved organic carbon.

Here, intracellular concentrations of 45 metabolites were quantified in three sea-ice diatom species and were compared to two temperate diatom species, with a focus on compatible solutes and free amino acid pools. There was a large diversity of metabolite concentrations between diatoms with no clear pattern identifiable for sea-ice species.

Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry revealed significant metabolic responses to C. heterostrophus infection and heat stress, and comparative analyses between these individual forms of stress demonstrated differential elicitation between the two global metabolomes. In combinatorial experiments, treatment with heat stress prior to fungal inoculation negatively impacted maize disease resistance against C. heterostrophus, and distinct metabolome separation between combinatorial stressed plants and the non-heat stressed infected controls was observed. Targeted analysis revealed inducible primary and secondary metabolite responses to biotic\/abiotic stress, and combinatorial experiments indicated that deficiency in the hydroxycinnamic acid, p-coumaric acid, may lead to the heat-induced susceptibility of maize to C. heterostrophus.

Methods: In a crossover, controlled feeding study, 80 healthy participants (n=40 men, n=40 women), 18-45 y were randomized to receive low-glycemic load (LGL) or high glycemic load (HGL) diets for 28 days each with at least a 28-day washout period between controlled diets. Fasting plasma samples were collected at baseline and end of each diet period. A clinical lipid panel including total-, VLDL-, LDL-, and HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides were measured using an auto-analyzer. Lipidomics analysis using mass-spectrometry provided the concentrations of 863 species. Linear mixed models were used to test for a diet effect. Results: Lipids from the clinical panel were not significantly different between diets. Lipidomics analysis showed that 67 lipid species, predominantly in the triacylglycerol class, differed between diets (FDR&lt;0.05). A majority of these were higher after the LGL diet compared to the HGL. Conclusion: While the clinical lipid measures did not differ between diets, some lipid species were higher after the LGL diet in the lipidomics analysis. The two diets were eucaloric and had similar percentage of energy from carbohydrate, protein and fat. Thus, the difference in macronutrient, particularly carbohydrate, quality of the LGL diet is likely affecting the composition of lipid species.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"1350":{"study_id":"ST001491","study_title":"Global Urine Metabolic Profiling to Predict Gestational Age in Term and Preterm Pregnancies","study_type":"","institute":"Stanford University","department":"","last_name":"Contrepois","first_name":"Kevin","email":"kcontrep@stanford.edu","phone":"6506664538","submit_date":"2020-09-27","study_summary":"Assessment of gestational age (GA) is key to provide optimal care during pregnancy. However, its accurate determination remains challenging in low- and middle-resource countries, where access to obstetric ultrasound is limited. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop clinical approaches that allow accurate and inexpensive estimation of GA. We investigated the ability of urinary metabolites to predict GA at time of collection in a diverse multi-site cohort (n = 99) using a broad-spectrum liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) platform. Our approach detected a myriad of steroid hormones and their derivatives including estrogens, progesterones, corticosteroids and androgens that associated with pregnancy progression. We developed a prediction model that predicted GA with high accuracy using the levels of three metabolites (rho = 0.87, .RMSE = 1.58 weeks). These predictions were robust irrespective of whether the pregnancy went to term or ended prematurely. Overall, we demonstrate the feasibility of implementing urine collection for metabolomics analysis in large-scale multi-site studies and we report a predictive model of GA with a potential clinical value.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"1351":{"study_id":"ST001492","study_title":"Global metabolomics of IFNy cued neurogenic NSCs seeded on hydrogel","study_type":"","institute":"University of Akron","department":"Chemistry","last_name":"Baumann","first_name":"Hannah","email":"hjb17@zips.uakron.edu","phone":"4198864033","submit_date":"2020-09-11","study_summary":"Neural stem cells (NSCs) provide a strategy to replace damaged neurons following traumatic central nervous system injuries. A major hurdle to translation of this therapy is that direct application of NSCs to CNS injury does not support sufficient neurogenesis due to lack of proper cues. To provide prolonged spatial cues to NSCs IFN-\u03b3 was immobilized to biomimetic hydrogel substrate to supply physical and biochemical signals to instruct the encapsulated NSCs to be neurogenic. However, the immobilization of factors, including IFN-\u03b3, versus soluble delivery of the same factor, has been incompletely characterized especially with respect to activation of signaling and metabolism in cells over longer time points. In this study, protein and metabolite changes in NSCs induced by immobilized versus soluble IFN-\u03b3 at 7 days were evaluated. Soluble IFN-\u03b3, refreshed daily over 7 days, elicited stronger responses in NSCs compared to immobilized IFN-\u03b3 indicating that immobilization may not sustain signaling or has altered ligand\/receptor interaction and integrity. However, both IFN-\u03b3 delivery types supported increased \u03b2III tubulin expression in parallel with canonical and non-canonical receptor-signaling compared to no IFN-\u03b3. Global metabolomics and pathway analysis revealed that soluble and immobilized IFN-\u03b3 altered metabolic pathway activities including energy, lipid and amino acid synthesis, with soluble IFN-\u03b3 having the greatest metabolic impact overall.","subject_species":"Rattus norvegicus"},"1352":{"study_id":"ST001493","study_title":"Dynamic binning peak detection and assessment of various lipidomics liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry pre-processing platforms","study_type":"","institute":"University of Groningen","department":"","last_name":"P\u00e9ter","first_name":"Horvatovich","email":"p.l.horvatovich@rug.nl","phone":"+31 (0)50 363 3341","submit_date":"2020-09-25","study_summary":"Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based lipidomics generate a large dataset, which requires high-performance data pre-processing tools for their interpretation such as XCMS, mzMine and Progenesis. These pre-processing tools rely heavily on accurate peak detection, which depends on setting the peak detection mass tolerance (PDMT) properly. The PDMT is usually set with a fixed value in either ppm or Da units. However, this fixed value may result in duplicates or missed peak detection. Therefore, we developed the dynamic binning method for accurate peak detection, which takes into account the peak broadening described by well-known physics laws of ion separation and set dynamically the value of PDMT as a function of m\/z. Namely, in our method, the PDMT is proportional to for FTICR, to for Orbitrap, to m\/z for Q-TOF and is a constant for Quadrupole mass analyzer, respectively. The dynamic binning method was implemented in XCMS. Our further goal was to compare the performance of different lipidomics pre-processing tools to find differential compounds. We have generated set samples with 43 lipids internal standards differentially spiked to aliquots of one human plasma lipid sample using Orbitrap LC-MS\/MS. The performance of the various pipelines using aligned parameter sets was quantified by a quality score system which reflects the ability of a pre-processing pipeline to detect differential peaks spiked at various concentration levels. The quality score indicates that the dynamic binning method improves the performance of XCMS (maximum p-value 9.8\u00b710-3 of two-sample Wilcoxon test). The modified XCMS software was further compared with mzMine and Progenesis. The results showed that modified XCMS and Progenesis had a similarly good performance in the aspect of finding differential compounds. In addition, Progenesis shows lower variability as indicated by lower CVs, followed by XCMS and mzMine. The lower variability of Progenesis improve the quantification, however, provide an incorrect quantification abundance order of spiked-in internal standards.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"1353":{"study_id":"ST001494","study_title":"Metabolomics of murine embryos cultured in a microfluidic device and comparison with traditional microdrops culture","study_type":"","institute":"University of Leeds","department":"","last_name":"Mancini","first_name":"Vanessa","email":"elvm@leeds.ac.uk","phone":"+447599197366","submit_date":"2020-08-29","study_summary":"Global untargeted metabolomics study to analyse culture media extracted from an innovative microfluidic device or traditional microdrops in presence or absence of murine embryos to investigate PDMS-release of biomolecules and embryo metabolic activity.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"1354":{"study_id":"ST001495","study_title":"Effects of Synbiotic Administration on Fecal Microbiome and Metabolomic Profiles of Dogs receiving Antibiotics","study_type":"untargeted metabolomics","institute":"University of California, Davis","department":"College of Biological Sciences","last_name":"Paglia","first_name":"Kelly","email":"kpaglia@ucdavis.edu","phone":"5307528129","submit_date":"2020-09-24","study_summary":"Effect of antibiotics on fecal microbiome and metabolome","subject_species":"Canis lupus familiaris"},"1355":{"study_id":"ST001496","study_title":"Application of developed quantatation method","study_type":"","institute":"Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research","department":"","last_name":"Haange","first_name":"Sven","email":"sven.haange@ufz.de","phone":"0049 341 2351099","submit_date":"2020-10-02","study_summary":"To apply this method in a pilot study, we spiked either taurine or sulfoquinovose into an in vitro simplified human microbiota model with and without Bilophila wadsworthia, a known sulfonate utilizer.","subject_species":"SIHUMI consortia"},"1356":{"study_id":"ST001497","study_title":"Intraday validation of of developed quantatation method","study_type":"","institute":"Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research","department":"","last_name":"Haange","first_name":"Sven","email":"sven.haange@ufz.de","phone":"0049 341 2351099","submit_date":"2020-10-02","study_summary":"To validate this method , we spiked either taurine or sulfoquinovose into fecal supernatents and determined intraday accuracy and precission of method","subject_species":"Fecal Bacteria"},"1357":{"study_id":"ST001498","study_title":"Interday validation of of developed quantatation method","study_type":"","institute":"Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research","department":"","last_name":"Haange","first_name":"Sven","email":"sven.haange@ufz.de","phone":"0049 341 2351099","submit_date":"2020-10-02","study_summary":"To validate this method , we spiked either taurine or sulfoquinovose into fecal supernatents and determined interday accuracy and precission of method","subject_species":"Fecal Bacteria"},"1358":{"study_id":"ST001499","study_title":"Metabolomics reveals the protective effect of isosteviol sodium against multiple organ injury in septic mice - Heart","study_type":"","institute":"Guangdong University of Technology","department":"","last_name":"Wang","first_name":"Shanping","email":"shanpingwang@outlook.com","phone":"15521002792","submit_date":"2020-09-29","study_summary":"Sepsis is a severe inflammatory disorder that can lead to multiple organ injury.

Self-reported vegans were required to have followed a vegan diet for a minimum of 6 months prior to enrollment. Key exclusion criteria included inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, or other chronic intestinal disorders; prior bowel resection surgery other than appendectomy; baseline bowel frequency less than every 2 days or greater than 3 times daily; creatinine concentration greater than the upper limit of normal; diabetes mellitus; currently smoking; body mass index (BMI) &lt;18.5 or &gt;35; and use of antibiotics and probiotics in the prior 6 months.

The vegan participants also completed three 24 hour diet recalls with a dietitian in the week prior to starting antibiotics. We randomly assigned the 20 omnivores to receive an omnivore diet or EEN (Modulen\u00ae IBD) while residing in an inpatient research unit. The macronutrient composition of Modulen\u00ae is protein 36g, fat 47g, and carbohydrate 110g per 1000 Kcal. The two omnivore diets were engineered to have a similar composition to EEN. All the subjects consumed the menu A on day 11 and menu B on days 4 and 14. Diets for omnivores were constructed to provide the expected total calories required per day for the participant to maintain their current weight and were adjusted if there was weight gain or loss of more than 2.5 pounds. On days 6, 7, and 8, inpatients participants received vancomycin 500mg orally every 6 hours and neomycin 1000mg orally every 6 hours.

Key exclusion criteria included inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, or other chronic intestinal disorders; prior bowel resection surgery other than appendectomy; baseline bowel frequency less than every 2 days or greater than 3 times daily; creatinine concentration greater than the upper limit of normal; diabetes mellitus; currently smoking; body mass index (BMI) &lt;18.5 or &gt;35; and use of antibiotics and probiotics in the prior 6 months. The 10 vegans continued to follow their usual diet as outpatients. All participants completed the Diet History Questionnaire II (DHQ II), a food frequency questionnaire developed by the Risk Factor Monitoring and Methods Branch of the National Cancer Institute. The vegan participants also completed three 24 hour diet recalls with a dietitian in the week prior to starting antibiotics. We randomly assigned the 20 omnivores to receive an omnivore diet or EEN (Modulen\u00ae IBD) while residing in an inpatient research unit. The macronutrient composition of Modulen\u00ae is protein 36g, fat 47g, and carbohydrate 110g per 1000 Kcal. The two omnivore diets were engineered to have a similar composition to EEN. All the subjects consumed the menu A on day 11 and menu B on days 4 and 14. Diets for omnivores were constructed to provide the expected total calories required per day for the participant to maintain their current weight and were adjusted if there was weight gain or loss of more than 2.5 pounds. On days 6, 7, and 8, inpatients participants received vancomycin 500mg orally every 6 hours and neomycin 1000mg orally every 6 hours.

While extremely abundant in the oceans, our understanding of their functions, both for cells and the emergent ecosystem, is in its infancy. To advance this understanding, we analyzed the lipid, metabolite, and protein content of vesicles produced by two strains of the most abundant phytoplankton cell in the ocean, the cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus. We show that Prochlorococcus exports an enormous array of cellular compounds into their surroundings via extracellular vesicles. The vesicles produced by the two different strains contained some materials in common, but also displayed numerous strain-specific differences, reflecting functional complexity within natural vesicle populations. Prochlorococcus vesicles contain active enzymes, indicating that they can mediate biogeochemically relevant extracellular reactions in the wild. Interaction assays demonstrate that vesicles from Prochlorococcus and multiple genera of heterotrophic bacteria can associate with other marine microbes, including Pelagibacter, the most abundant heterotrophic group in the oceans. Our observations suggest that vesicles may play diverse functional roles in the oceans, including but not limited to mediating energy and nutrient transfers, catalyzing extracellular biochemical reactions, and mitigating toxicity of reactive oxygen species. These findings further indicate that a portion of the \u2018dissolved\u2019 compounds in the oceans are not truly dissolved, but are instead packaged within locally structured, colloidal vesicles.","subject_species":"Prochlorococcus marinus str.

Maximal respiratory rate capacity, a metabolic performance measure, is one of the best predictors of cardiovascular- and all-cause mortality.

We found that positive changes in indices of mitochondrial health in cardiomyocytes (respiratory reserve, maximal respiratory capacity, resistance to mitochondrial permeability transition, autophagy\/mitophagy, higher lipids-over-glucose utilization) are uniformly associated with the extended longevity in HCR vs. LCR female rats. Cross-sectional heart metabolomics revealed pathways from lipid metabolism in the heart which were significantly enriched by a select group of strain dependent metabolites, consistent with enhanced lipids utilization by HCR cardiomyocytes. Heart-liver-serum metabolomics further revealed shunting of lipidic substrates between liver and heart via serum during aging. Thus, mitochondrial health in cardiomyocytes is associated with extended longevity in rats with higher intrinsic exercise capacity, and likely these findings can be translated to other populations as predictors of outcomes of health and survival.","subject_species":"Rattus norvegicus"},"1381":{"study_id":"ST001527","study_title":"Lung cancer metabolomics analysis","study_type":"","institute":"University of Louisville","department":"Bioengineering","last_name":"Frieboes","first_name":"Hermann","email":"hbfrie01@louisville.edu","phone":"502-852-3302","submit_date":"2020-09-16","study_summary":"This study explored models predictive of staging and chemotherapy response based on metabolomic analysis of fresh, patient-derived non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) core biopsies.

The mechanisms behind how caloric imbalance occurs are complex and influenced by numerous biological and environmental factors, especially genetics and diet. Population-based diet recommendations have had limited success partly due to the wide variation in physiological responses across individuals when they consume the same diet. Thus, it is necessary to broaden our understanding of how individual genetics and diet interact relative to the development of obesity for improving weight loss treatment. To determine how consumption of diets with different macronutrient composition alter adiposity and other obesity-related traits in a genetically diverse population, we analyzed body composition, metabolic rate, clinical blood chemistries, and circulating metabolites in 22 strains of mice from the Collaborative Cross (CC), a highly diverse recombinant inbred mouse population, before and after 8 weeks of feeding either a high protein or high fat high sucrose diet. At both baseline and post-diet, adiposity and other obesity-related traits exhibited a broad range of phenotypic variation based on CC strain; diet-induced changes in adiposity and other traits also depended largely on CC strain. In addition to estimating heritability at baseline, we also quantified the effect size of diet for each trait, which varied by trait and experimental diet. Our findings identified CC strains prone to developing obesity, demonstrate the genotypic and phenotypic diversity of the CC for studying complex traits, and highlight the importance of accounting for genetic differences when making dietary recommendations.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"1387":{"study_id":"ST001608","study_title":"Comparing gas chromatography with time-of-flight, quadrupole time-of-flight and quadrupole mass spectrometry for stable isotope tracing (part-I)","study_type":"","institute":"University of California, Davis","department":"","last_name":"Zhang","first_name":"Ying","email":"ythzhang@ucdavis.edu","phone":"+1-530-754-8258","submit_date":"2020-11-19","study_summary":"Stable isotope tracers are applied in vivo and in vitro studies to reveal the activity of enzymes and intracellular metabolic pathways.

Overall, all three GC-MS instruments (low-resolution GC-SQ-MS, low-resolution GC-TOF-MS, and high-resolution GC-Q-TOF-MS) can be used to perform stable isotope tracing studies for glycolytic intermediates, TCA metabolites and amino acids, yielding similar biological results, with high-resolution GC-Q-TOF-MS offering additional capabilities to identify chemical structures of unknown compounds that might show significant isotope enrichments in biological studies.","subject_species":"Rothia mucilaginosa"},"1393":{"study_id":"ST001614","study_title":"NMR metabolomics analysis of ricin-induced and fasting hypoglycemia (part-I)","study_type":"Targeted NMR","institute":"Montana State University","department":"Chemistry & Biochemistry","last_name":"Kempa","first_name":"Jake","email":"jkempa97@gmail.com","phone":"4067997200","submit_date":"2020-09-23","study_summary":"Mice were subject to ricin exposure or fasting conditions for 2 hours, 8 hours, or an overnight time period.

Blood plasma was extracted following the methyl-tert-butyl ether (MTBE) extraction protocols. The choice of internal standards and chromatographic conditions was optimized by using toluene in the reconstitution solvent mixture to ensure that very lipophilic components like cholesteryl esters (CEs) and triacylglycerols (TAGs) are efficiently transferred to the ultrahigh-pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC) column in the injection process. Lipids were analyzed by charged surface hybrid column electrospray ionization quadrupole time of flight tandem mass spectrometer (CSH-ESI QTOF MS\/MS). The analytical ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC) column is protected by a short guard column which was replaced after 400 injections while the UHPLC column was replaced after 1,200 serum (or plasma) extract injections. The sequence of column replacements were evaluated to ensure no detrimental effects were detected with respect to peak shapes, absolute or relative lipid retention times or reproducibility of quantifications. Automatic valve switching was used after each injection to reduce sample carryover for highly lipophilic compounds. This valve switching employed a dual solvent wash, first with a water\/acetonitrile mixture (1:1, v\/v) and subsequently with a 100% isopropanol wash. LC-BinBase was used as an untargeted approach for annotating chromatographic peaks and spectra against a dynamically built library of compounds. The quantified raw dataset was normalized by the SERRF bioinformatics pipeline [1]. In the LC-QTOF data, samples were removed before normalization if they failed the laboratory\u2019s QC standards or were missing data for more than half of the compounds. The SERRF normalized data have been made available for identified compounds. Results data for unidentified compounds are available un-normalized. An explanation of the study design variables are explained in detail in a data dictionary provided in the raw data download section.

Yet, the complexity of the brain metabolome and its changes during diseases or aging remains poorly understood. To start bridging this gap, we generated a metabolome atlas of the aging mouse brain from 10 anatomical regions spanning from adolescence to late adulthood. We combined data from three chromatography-based mass spectrometry assays and structurally annotated 1,709 metabolites to reveal the underlying architecture of aging-induced changes in the brain metabolome. Overall differences between sexes were minimal. We found 94% of all metabolites to significantly differ between brain sections in at least one age group. We also discovered that 90% of the metabolome showed significant changes with respect to age groups. For example, we identified a shift in sphingolipid patterns during aging that is related to myelin remodeling in the transition from adolescent to adult brains. This shift was accompanied by large changes in overall signature in a range of other metabolic pathways. We found clear metabolic similarities in brain sections that were functionally related such as brain stem, cerebrum and cerebellum. In cerebrum, metabolic correlation patterns got markedly weaker in the transition from adolescent to ear adults, whereas correlation patterns between cerebrum and brainstem regions decreased from early to late adulthood. We were also able to map metabolic changes to gene and protein brain atlases to link molecular changes to metabolic brain phenotypes. Metabolic profiles can be investigated via https:\/\/atlas.metabolomics.us\/. This new resource enables brain researchers to link new metabolomic studies to a foundation data set.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"1417":{"study_id":"ST001638","study_title":"Metabolomics analysis of Vehicle (DMSO\/PBS; (1:1) v\/v) and DRB18 (10 mg\/kg) treated A549 xenograft tumors","study_type":"Anticancer compound treatment experiment in vivo","institute":"Ohio University","department":"Biological Sciences","last_name":"Shriwas","first_name":"Pratik","email":"ps774614@ohio.edu","phone":"7406033801","submit_date":"2020-12-07","study_summary":"A549 xenograft tumors were treated with (DMSO\/PBS; (1:1) v\/v) and DRB18 (10 mg\/kg) for 5 weeks.

In vitro analysis showed CPAs and CPs had reduced count, faster CD62P expression and increased lactadherin binding. Furthermore, CPAs and CPs had higher maximal aggregation and a reduced aggregation lag phase compared to RPs. Metabolomic analysis revealed CPAs and CPs exhibited lower oxidative stress shown by preserved glutathione and pentose phosphate pools. CPAs and CPs also had reduced markers of beta-oxidation and amino acid catabolism demonstrating reduced needs for energy.

One of the important strategies for plants to deal with the stress is involved in metabolic regulation, causing the dramatic changes of metabolite profiles. Metabolomic studies have been intensively conducted to reveal the responses of plants to abiotic stress, but most of them were limited to one or at most two abiotic stresses in a single experiment. In this study, we compared the metabolite profiles of barley seedlings exposed to seven abiotic stresses simultaneously, including drought, salt stress, aluminum (Al), cadmium (Cd), deficiency of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K). The results showed that metabolite profiles of barley under these stresses could be classified into three types: osmotic stresses (drought and salt); metal stresses (Al and Cd) and nutrient deficiencies (N, P and K deficiencies). Compared with the control, some metabolites (including polyamines, raffinose and piperonic acid) in plants exposed to all abiotic stresses changed significantly, while some other metabolites showed the specific change only under a certain abiotic stress, such as proline being largely increased by osmotic stress (drought and salinity), the P-containing metabolites being largely decreased under P deficiency, some amino acids (lysine, tyrosine, threonine, ornithine\uff0c glutamine and so on) showing the dramatic reduction in the plants exposed to N deficiencies, respectively. The current meta-analysis obtained a comprehensive view on the metabolic responses to various abiotic stress, and improved the understanding of the mechanisms for tolerance of barley to abiotic stress.","subject_species":"Hordeum vulgare L."},"1426":{"study_id":"ST001649","study_title":"Urinary microbiota and metabolome in pediatric vesicoureteral reflux and scarring","study_type":"Observational\/cross-sectional","institute":"University of Missouri-Columbia","department":"MU Metabolomics Center","last_name":"Sarma","first_name":"Saurav","email":"sarmas@missouri.edu","phone":"5738825596","submit_date":"2021-01-01","study_summary":"We enrolled girls and boys aged zero to nine years presenting to a pediatric urologist for recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) or renal scarring (decreased uptake on a nuclear renal scan) or grade 3-5 vesico ureteral reflux (VUR).

The current diagnostics for Valley fever are severely lacking due to poor sensitivity and invasiveness, contributing to a 23-day median time-to-diagnosis, and therefore new diagnostic tools are needed. We are working toward the development of a breath-based diagnostic for coccidioidomycosis, and in this initial study we characterized the volatile metabolomes (or volatilomes) of in vitro cultures of Coccidioides. Using solid-phase microextraction and comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC\u00d7GC\u2013TOFMS), we characterized the VOCs produced by six strains of each species during mycelial or spherule growth. We detected a total of 353 VOCs that were at least two-fold more abundant in a Coccidioides culture versus medium controls and found the volatile metabolome of Coccidioides is more dependent on growth phase (spherule versus mycelia) than on the species.

Constant neutral loss monitoring of 2\u00b4-deoxyribose or the nucleobases using data-dependent acquisition represents a powerful approach for the unbiased detection of DNA modifications (adducts). The lack of available bioinformatics tools necessitates manual processing of acquired spectral data and hampers high throughput application of these techniques. To address this limitation, we present an automated workflow for the detection and curation of putative DNA adducts by using diagnostic fragmentation filtering of LC-MS\/MS experiments within the open-source software MZmine. The workflow utilizes a new feature detection algorithm, DFBuilder, which employs diagnostic fragmentation filtering using a user-defined list of fragmentation patterns to reproducibly generate feature lists for precursor ions of interest. The DFBuilder feature detection approach readily fits into a complete small molecule discovery workflow and drastically reduces the processing time associated with analyzing DNA adductomics results. We validate our workflow using a mixture of authentic DNA adduct standards and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by reproducing and expanding the results of a previously published study of colibactin-induced DNA adducts. The reported workflow serves as a technique to assess the diagnostic potential of novel fragmentation pattern combinations for the unbiased detection of chemical classes of interest.","subject_species":"-"},"1439":{"study_id":"ST001662","study_title":"LC-MS Metabolomics of Urine Reveals Distinct Profiles for Low- and High-Grade Bladder Cancer","study_type":"","institute":"Health Research Institute Hospital La Fe","department":"","last_name":"Roca Marug\u00e1n","first_name":"Marta","email":"marta_roca@iislafe.es","phone":"680888576","submit_date":"2021-01-21","study_summary":"Bladder cancer (BC) is among the most frequent malignancies worldwide.

We prospectively recruited 64 BC patients (19 TaG1, 11 TaG3, 20 T1G3, 12 T2G3, 1 T2G2, 1 T3G3) and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers without evidence of renal or bladder condition confirmed by ultrasound, from whom we collected a first morning urine sample (before surgery in patients).

We selected the discriminant variables between groups with a supervised orthogonal-least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) analysis and we identified them by querying their exact mass against those presented in online databases through a mediator platform. Subsequently, we confirmed the dysregulated metabolites when chemical standards were commercially available. We compared all clinical groups of patients with controls and we identified dysregulated metabolites in every comparison.

The comprehensive characterization of metabolic, proteomic and immune cell events that precede the spontaneous onset of labor is a key step to understanding these physiological transitions and identifying predictive biomarkers of parturition. Here, over 7,000 circulating plasma analytes and peripheral immune cell responses collected during the last 100 days of pregnancy were integrated into a multi-omic model that accurately predicted the time to spontaneous onset of labor (R = 0.85, p-value = 1.2e-40, training set; R = 0.81, p-value = 3.9e-7, independent test set). Coordinated fluctuations marked a molecular shift from pregnancy progression to pre-labor onset biology 2\u20134 weeks before delivery.

The four PFASs commonly detected in blood, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) 3,4, are present in drinking water supplies both in northern New England as well as in 27 states nationally 5-8. Animal models shows that PFASs have can have effects on both the endocrine system and on adiposity 9-12. Epidemiological evidence shows that the presence of PFASs in maternal serum is associated with changes in maternal serum lipid and cholesterol composition 13,14. Similarly, serum levels of PFAS in adolescents have been associated with increases in serum cholesterol 15. These findings raise interesting questions about the association of PFAS and lipids in human milk. Research has shown the PFASs are present in human milk 16-18, and human milk is composed primarily of lipids 19. However, the relation between PFAS in milk and milk composition is unclear. The chemical and compositional profiles of breast milk are important because of the potential effects on the developing infant. The developmental origins of health and disease hypothesis suggests that early life exposures, such as toxins and nutrients via breast milk, have lasting effects on health, particularly obesity outcomes 20. In fact, some studies have shown associations between PFAS in maternal serum and infant birth weight and later childhood BMI 14,21. Our study will help to better illuminate the potential effects of maternal exposure to PFASs on infant exposure, both through direct transmission into breast milk and indirectly via influence on the lipid profiles of milk. To investigate how early life exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) may affect childhood health outcomes as mediated through breast milk, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Characterize the levels of PFAS in breast milk samples (n=495) in the NHBCS; 2. Characterize the lipid profiles of breast milk samples (n=495) in the NHBCS; 3. Test the relation between PFAS concentration and breast milk lipid profiles; and 4. Test the association between PFAS concentrations in maternal plasma collected during pregnancy with paired breast milk samples (n=100).","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"1470":{"study_id":"ST001699","study_title":"A cross-sectional study of functional and metabolic changes during aging through the lifespan in male mice (Muscle) part-I","study_type":"","institute":"National Institutes of Health","department":"NIA","last_name":"de Cabo","first_name":"Rafael","email":"deCaboRa@grc.nia.nih.gov","phone":"1-410-558-8510","submit_date":"2021-02-11","study_summary":"Aging is associated with distinct phenotypical, physiological, and functional changes, leading to the onset of disease and death.

Irradiation interferes with trabecular architecture through increased osteoclastic activity, decreased osteoblastic activity, and increased adipocyte expansion in the bone marrow (BM), which further compounds bone-related disease. Neutralizing antibodies to sclerostin (Scl-Ab) increase bone mass and strength by increasing bone formation and reducing bone resorption. We hypothesized that treatment with Scl-Ab would attenuate the adverse effects of irradiation by increasing bone volume and decreasing BM adipose tissue (BMAT), resulting in better quality bone. In this study, 12-week-old female C57BL\/6J mice were exposed to 6 Gy whole-body irradiation or were non-irradiated, then administered Scl-Ab (25 mg\/kg) or vehicle weekly for 5 weeks. Femoral \u00b5CT analysis confirmed that the overall effect of IR significantly decreased trabecular bone volume\/total volume (Tb.BV\/TV) (2-way ANOVA, p&lt;0.0001) with a -43.8% loss in Tb.BV\/TV in the IR control group. Scl-Ab independently increased Tb.BV\/TV by 3.07-fold in non-irradiated and 3.6-fold in irradiated mice (2-way ANOVA, p&lt;0.0001). Irradiation did not affect cortical parameters, although Scl-Ab increased cortical thickness and area significantly in both irradiated and non-irradiated mice (2-way ANOVA, p&lt;0.0001). Femoral mechanical testing confirmed Scl-Ab significantly increased bending rigidity and ultimate moment independently of irradiation (2-way ANOVA, p&lt;0.0001). Static and dynamic histomorphometry of the femoral metaphysis revealed osteoblast vigor, not number, was significantly increased in the irradiated mice treated with Scl-Ab. Systemic alterations were assessed through serum lipidomic analysis, which showed that Scl-Ab normalized lipid profiles in the irradiated group. This data supports the theory of sclerostin as a novel contributor to the regulation of osteoblast activity after irradiation. Overall, our data support the hypothesis that Scl-Ab ameliorates the deleterious effects of whole-body irradiation on bone and adipose tissue in a mouse model. Our findings suggest that future research into localized and systemic therapies after irradiation exposure is warranted.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"1476":{"study_id":"ST001705","study_title":"Machine learning-enabled renal cell carcinoma status prediction using multi-platform urine-based metabolomics (part-I)","study_type":"","institute":"University of Georgia","department":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology","last_name":"Bifarin","first_name":"Olatomiwa","email":"olatomiwa.bifarin25@uga.edu","phone":"757-405-4379","submit_date":"2021-02-11","study_summary":"Currently, Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) is identified through expensive cross-sectional imaging, frequently followed by renal mass biopsy, which is invasive and subject to sampling errors.

Understanding the metabolic implications of this mutation will aid to establish its wider impact on cellular behaviour and potentially inform clinical decisions. However, to date, alterations in lipid metabolism induced by APC mutations remain unclear. Intestinal organoids have gained widespread popularity in studying colorectal cancer and chemotherapies, because their three-dimensional structure more accurately mimics an in vivo environment. Here, we aimed to investigate intra-cellular lipid disturbances induced by APC gene mutations in intestinal organoids using a reversed-phase ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (RP-UHPLC-MS)-based lipid profiling method. Lipids of the organoids grown from either wildtype (WT) or mice with Apc mutations (Lgr5\u2013EGFP-IRES-CreERT2 Apcfl\/fl) were extracted and analysed using RP-UHPLC-MS. Concentrations of phospholipids (e.g. PC(16:0\/16:0), PC(18:1\/20:0), PC(38:0), PC(18:1\/22:1)), ceramides (e.g. Cer(d18:0\/22:0), Cer(d42:0), Cer(d18:1\/24:1)) and hexosylceramide (e.g. HexCer(d18:1\/16:0), HexCer(d18:1\/22:0)) were higher in Apcfl\/fl organoids, whereas levels of sphingomyelins (e.g. SM(d18:1\/14:0), SM(d18:1\/16:0) ) were lower compared to WT. These observations indicate that cellular metabolism of sphingomyelin was upregulated, resulting in the cellular accumulation of ceramides and production of HexCer due to the absence of Apcfl\/fl in the organoids. Our observations demonstrated lipid profiling of organoids and provided an enhanced insight into the effects of the APC mutations on lipid metabolism, making for a valuable addition to screening options of the organoid lipidome.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"1479":{"study_id":"ST001708","study_title":"Oxylipin biosynthesis reinforces cellular senescence through a RAS\/p53 feedback loop and allows detection of senolysis","study_type":"","institute":"Buck Institute for Research on Aging","department":"","last_name":"Sharma","first_name":"Rishi","email":"sharmarishi2004@yahoo.co.in","phone":"5084392367","submit_date":"2021-02-20","study_summary":"Cellular senescence is a stress or damage response that causes a permanent proliferative arrest and secretion of numerous factors with potent biological activities.

SARS-CoV-2 also reduces host cell oxidative glutamine metabolism while maintaining reductive carboxylation. Consistent with these changes in host cell metabolism, we show that SARS-CoV-2 increases activity of mTORC1, a master regulator of anabolic metabolism, in cell lines and patient lung stem cell-derived airway epithelial cells. We also show evidence of mTORC1 activation in COVID-19 patient lung tissue. Notably, mTORC1 inhibitors reduce viral replication in kidney epithelial cells and patient-derived lung stem cell cultures.

Here, we determined the crystal structure of the tetratricopeptide repeat domain of PTPIP51 (PTPIP51_TPR), a mitochondrial protein that interacts with the ER-anchored VAPB protein at MAMs. The structure of PTPIP51_TPR showed an archetypal TPR fold, and an electron density corresponding to an unidentified lipid-like molecule probably derived from the protein expression host was found in the structure. We revealed functions of PTPIP51 in phospholipid binding\/transfer, particularly of phosphatidic acid, in vitro. Depletion of PTPIP51 in cells reduced the mitochondrial cardiolipin level. Additionally, we confirmed that the PTPIP51\u2013VAPB interaction is mediated by the FFAT-like motif of PTPIP51 and the MSP domain of VAPB.

Intestinal tract contains diverse set of proteases mediating digestion, microbial responses, epithelial and immune signaling. Transit of chyme through the intestinal tract results in significant suppression of proteases. Although endogenous protease inhibitors have been identified, the broader mechanisms underlying protease regulation in the intestinal tract remains unclear. The objective of this study was to determine microbial regulation of proteolytic activity in intestinal tract using phenotype of post-infection irritable bowel syndrome, a condition characterized by high fecal proteolytic activity. Proteases of host pancreatic origin (chymotrypsin like pancreatic elastase 2A, 3B and trypsin 2) drove proteolytic activity. Of the 14 differentially abundant taxa, high proteolytic activity state was characterized by complete absence of the commensal Alistipes putredinis. Germ free mice had very high proteolytic activity (10-fold of specific-pathogen free mice) which dropped significantly upon humanization with microbiota from healthy volunteers. In contrast, high proteolytic activity microbiota failed to inhibit it, a defect that corrected with fecal microbiota transplant as well as addition of A. putredinis. These mice also had increased intestinal permeability similar to that seen in patients. Microbiota \u03b2-glucuronidases mediate bilirubin deconjugation and unconjugated bilirubin is an inhibitor of serine proteases. We found that high proteolytic activity patients had lower urobilinogen levels, a product of bilirubin deconjugation. Mice colonized with \u03b2-glucuronidase overexpressing E. coli demonstrated significant inhibition of proteolytic activity and treatment with \u03b2-glucuronidase inhibitors increased it. The findings establish that specific commensal microbiota mediates effective inhibition of host pancreatic proteases and maintains intestinal barrier function through the production of \u03b2-glucuronidases. This suggests an important homeostatic role for commensal intestinal microbiota.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"1489":{"study_id":"ST001719","study_title":"Metabolomics Analysis of Philadelphia Cohort - Update (part-I)","study_type":"Metabolomics Analysis","institute":"The Wistar Institute","department":"","last_name":"Abdel-Mohsen","first_name":"Mohamed","email":"mmohsen@wistar.org","phone":"215-898-6008","submit_date":"2021-01-07","study_summary":"Global metabolomics analysis of Philadelphia cohort","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"1490":{"study_id":"ST001720","study_title":"Metabolomics Analysis of ACTG Cohort -Update (part-II)","study_type":"Metabolomics Analysis","institute":"The Wistar Institute","department":"","last_name":"Abdel-Mohsen","first_name":"Mohamed","email":"mmohsen@wistar.org","phone":"215-898-6008","submit_date":"2021-01-07","study_summary":"Global metabolomics analysis of ACTG cohort","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"1491":{"study_id":"ST001721","study_title":"Detecting sex-related changes to the metabolome of a critically endangered freshwater crayfish during the mating season","study_type":"LC-MS analysis of crustacean haemolymph","institute":"Edith Cowan University","department":"School of Science","last_name":"Lette","first_name":"Emily","email":"e.lette@ecu.edu.au","phone":"+61 8 6304 5513","submit_date":"2021-02-25","study_summary":"Captive breeding is a vital tool in the conservation of highly endangered species, as it is for the Margaret River hairy marron, Cherax tenuimanus, from the south west of Australia. A close relative, Cherax cainii, has almost completely displaced C. tenuimanus in the wild and is a successful aquaculture species, whereas C. tenuimanus has performed poorly in captivity. We used untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to obtain metabolomic profiles of female and male C. tenuimanus held in controlled aquarium conditions during their reproductive period. Using repeated haemolymph sampling we tracked the metabolomic profiles of animals just prior to and for a period of up to 34 days after pairing with a similar sized potential mate. We identified 54 reproducible annotated metabolites including amino acids, fatty acids, biogenic amines, purine and pyrimidine metabolites and excretion metabolites. Hierarchical clustering analysis distinguished five metabolite clusters. Principal component-canonical variate analysis clearly distinguished females from males, both unpaired and paired; similar trends in profile changes in both sexes after pairing; and a striking shift in males upon pairing. We discuss three main patterns of metabolomic responses: differentiation between sexes; reactive responses to the disturbance of pairing; and convergent response to the disturbance of pairing for males. Females generally had higher concentrations of metabolites involved in metabolic rate, mobilisation of energy stores and stress. Responses to the disturbance of pairing were also related to elevated stress. Females were mobilising lipid stores to deposit yolk, whereas males had a rapid and strong response to pairing, with shifts in metabolites associated with gonad development and communication, indicating males could complete reproductive readiness only once paired with a female. The metabolomic profiles support a previously proposed potential mechanism for displacement of C. tenuimanus by C. cainii in the wild and identify several biomarkers for testing hypotheses regarding reproductive success using targeted metabolomics.","subject_species":"Cherax tenuimanus"},"1492":{"study_id":"ST001722","study_title":"The effects of birth weight and breeding value for protein deposition on the plasma metabolome in growing pigs (part-I)","study_type":"","institute":"Aarhus University","department":"Animal Science","last_name":"Hedemann","first_name":"Mette","email":"Mette.Hedemann@anis.au.dk","phone":"51448783","submit_date":"2021-03-12","study_summary":"An experiment was conducted with growing pigs, to determine the effects of birth weight (BiW) and estimated breeding value for protein deposition (EBV) on the metabolomic profile in plasma samples collected under different dietary regimens: protein adequate (A) or protein restricted (R, 70% of A).","subject_species":"Sus scrofa"},"1493":{"study_id":"ST001723","study_title":"The effects of birth weight and breeding value for protein deposition on the plasma metabolome in growing pigs (part-II)","study_type":"","institute":"Aarhus University","department":"Animal Science","last_name":"Hedemann","first_name":"Mette","email":"Mette.Hedemann@anis.au.dk","phone":"51448783","submit_date":"2021-03-14","study_summary":"An experiment was conducted with growing pigs, to determine the effects of birth weight (BiW) and estimated breeding value for protein deposition (EBV) on the metabolomic profile in plasma samples collected under different dietary regimens: protein adequate (A) or protein restricted (R, 70% of A).","subject_species":"Sus scrofa"},"1494":{"study_id":"ST001724","study_title":"The effects of birth weight and breeding value for protein deposition on the urine metabolome in growing pigs (part-III)","study_type":"","institute":"Aarhus University","department":"Animal Science","last_name":"Hedemann","first_name":"Mette","email":"Mette.Hedemann@anis.au.dk","phone":"51448783","submit_date":"2021-03-15","study_summary":"An experiment was conducted with growing pigs, to determine the effects of birth weight (BiW) and estimated breeding value for protein deposition (EBV) on the metabolomic profile in urine samples collected under different dietary regimens: protein adequate (A) or protein restricted (R, 70% of A).","subject_species":"Sus scrofa"},"1495":{"study_id":"ST001725","study_title":"Lipidomics dataset of Danio rerio optic nerve regeneration model","study_type":"","institute":"University of Miami","department":"","last_name":"Bhattacharya","first_name":"Sanjoy","email":"sbhattacharya@med.miami.edu","phone":"13054824103","submit_date":"2021-03-12","study_summary":"The right optic nerve of 1 year old female and male Danio rerio were crushed and collected three days after.

These powerful effects of manipulating the gastrointestinal tract point to an important role of gastrointestinal signals in regulating both energy balance and metabolism. To that end, we have used mouse models of VSG to identify key gut signals that mediate these beneficial effects. Previous data from our rodent model of VSG led us to hypothesize a potential role for the hormone Fibroblast-Growth Factor15\/19 (mouse\/human ortholog) which pharmacologically can regulate many aspects of energy homeostasis and glucose handling. FGF15 is expressed in ileal enterocytes of the small intestine and is released postprandially. Like many other gut hormones, postprandial plasma concentrations of the human ortholog FGF19 and ileal FGF15 expression in mice increase after VSG. We generated intestinal-specific FGF15 knock out (VilCreERT2; Fgf15f\/f) mice and controls, which were maintained on 60% high-fat diet. VSG resulted in increased plasma bile acid levels. However, intestinal-specific FGF15 knock out mice had considerably higher levels of circulating total and hydrophobic bile acids after VSG. Unlike what we had predicted, intestinal-specific FGF15 knock out mice lost more weight after VSG as a result of increased lean tissue loss compared to control mice. Further, the loss of bone mineral density and bone marrow adipose tissue observed after VSG in control mice was even greater in intestinal-specific FGF15 knock out mice, perhaps secondary to anemia and elevated erythropoietin\/FGF23. Finally the effect of VSG to improve glucose tolerance and to reduce hepatic cholesterol was also absent in intestinal-specific FGF15 knock out mice. These data point to an important role for intestinal FGF15 to protect the organism from deleterious effects of bile acid toxicity after VSG.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"1513":{"study_id":"ST001744","study_title":"X13CMS: Global Tracking of Isotopic Labels in Untargeted Metabolomics","study_type":"Untargeted metabolomics","institute":"Washington University in St. Louis","department":"","last_name":"Cho","first_name":"Kevin","email":"kevin.cho@wustl.edu","phone":"314-935-8813","submit_date":"2021-03-16","study_summary":"Studies of isotopically labeled compounds have been fundamental to understanding metabolic pathways and fluxes. They have traditionally, however, been used in conjunction with targeted analyses that identify and quantify a limited number of labeled downstream metabolites. Here we describe an alternative workflow that leverages recent advances in untargeted metabolomic technologies to track the fates of isotopically labeled metabolites in a global, unbiased manner. This untargeted approach can be applied to discover novel biochemical pathways and characterize changes in the fates of labeled metabolites as a function of altered biological conditions such as disease. To facilitate the data analysis, we introduce X13CMS, an extension of the widely used mass spectrometry-based metabolomic software package XCMS. X13CMS uses the XCMS platform to detect metabolite peaks and perform retention-time alignment in liquid chromatography\/mass spectrometry (LC\/MS) data. With the use of the XCMS output, the program then identifies isotopologue groups that correspond to isotopically labeled compounds. The retrieval of these groups is done without any a priori knowledge besides the following input parameters: (i) the mass difference between the unlabeled and labeled isotopes, (ii) the mass accuracy of the instrument used in the analysis, and (iii) the estimated retention-time reproducibility of the chromatographic method. Despite its name, X13CMS can be used to track any isotopic label. Additionally, it detects differential labeling patterns in biological samples collected from parallel control and experimental conditions. We validated the ability of X13CMS to accurately retrieve labeled metabolites from complex biological matrices both with targeted LC\/MS\/MS analysis of a subset of the hits identified by the program and with labeled standards spiked into cell extracts. We demonstrate the full functionality of X13CMS with an analysis of cultured rat astrocytes treated with uniformly labeled (U-)13C-glucose during lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. Our results show that out of 223 isotopologue groups enriched from U-13C-glucose, 95 have statistically significant differential labeling patterns in astrocytes challenged with LPS compared to unchallenged control cells. Only two of these groups overlap with the 32 differentially regulated peaks identified by XCMS, indicating that X13CMS uncovers different and complementary information from untargeted metabolomic studies. Like XCMS, X13CMS is implemented in R.

In murine models, AKI is characterized by increased circulating cytokines, lung chemokine upregulation, and neutrophilic infiltration, similar to other causes of indirect acute lung injury (ALI)(e.g., sepsis). Many causes of lung inflammation are associated with a lung metabolic profile characterized by increased oxidative stress, a shift towards the use of other forms of energy production, and\/or a depleted energy state. To our knowledge, there are no studies that have evaluated pulmonary energy production and metabolism after AKI. We hypothesized that based on the parallels between inflammatory acute lung injury and AKI-mediated lung injury, a similar metabolic profile would be observed. Lung metabolomics and ATP levels were assessed 4 hours, 24 hours, and 7 days after ischemic AKI in mice. Numerous novel findings regarding the effect of AKI on the lung were observed including 1) increased oxidative stress, 2) a shift toward alternate methods of energy production, and 3) depleted levels of ATP.

In this study, we measured the metabolite abundance of glycolytic and citric acid cycle intermediates using LC-MS.","subject_species":"Vibrio cholerae"},"1521":{"study_id":"ST001753","study_title":"Modifying Chromatography Conditions for Improved Unknown Feature Identification in Untargeted Metabolomics","study_type":"","institute":"University of Michigan","department":"Chemistry\/Internal Medicine\/CCMB\/Biomedical Research Core Facilities","last_name":"Anderson","first_name":"Brady","email":"anderbra@umich.edu","phone":"734-232-8177","submit_date":"2021-09-09","study_summary":"Project represents an effort to modify chromatographic conditions for improved compound identification in untargeted metabolomics.

However, the molecular mechanisms that drive OSCC metastasis are unknown. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-bound particles that play a role in intercellular communication and impact cancer development and progression. Thus, profiling EVs would be of great significance to decipher the role of EV cargo in OSCC metastasis. For that purpose, we used a reductionist approach to map the proteomic, miRNA, metabolomic, and lipidomic profiles of extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from human primary tumor (SCC-9) cells and matched lymph node metastases (LN1) cells. Distinct omics profiles were associated with the metastatic phenotype, including 670 proteins, 217 miRNAs, 26 metabolites, and 64 lipids differentially abundant between LN1- and SCC-9-derived EVs. A multi-omics integration identified 11 \u2018hub proteins\u2019 significantly decreased at the metastatic site compared to primary tumor-derived EVs. We confirmed the validity of these findings with analysis of data from multiple public databases, and found that low abundance of seven hub proteins in metastatic EVs is correlated with reduced survival and tumor aggressiveness in cancer patients. In summary, this multi-omics approach identified proteins transported by EVs that are associated with metastasis, and which may potentially serve as prognostic markers in OSCC.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"1524":{"study_id":"ST001756","study_title":"Metabolomics of mouse feces comparing GF and CONV-R mice","study_type":"untargeted metabolomics","institute":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","department":"Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering","last_name":"Lai","first_name":"Yunjia","email":"yunjia.lai@outlook.com","phone":"9194805489","submit_date":"2021-04-26","study_summary":"Using high coverage metabolomics, we profiled feces, blood sera and cerebral cortical brain tissues of germ-free C57BL\/6 mice and their age-matched conventionally raised counterparts.

First, we determined that the G protein-coupled receptor (Gpr1\/Gpa2) directs early events in glucose utilization while the transceptors (Snf3\/Rgt2) regulate subsequent processes and downstream products of glucose metabolism. Whereas the large G protein transmits the signal from its cognate receptor, Ras2 (but not Ras1) integrates responses from both receptor pathways. Second, we determined the relative contributions of the G protein \u03b1 (Gpa2) and \u03b2 (Asc1) subunits to glucose-initiated processes. We determined that Gpa2 is primarily involved in regulating carbohydrate metabolism while Asc1 is primarily involved in amino acid metabolism.

The impact of \u03b2-adrenoceptor signalling on macrophage metabolism has not been defined. Here we expand on defining the phenotype of macrophages treated with isoprenaline and describe the impact that \u03b2AR signalling has on the metabolome and proteome. We found that \u03b2AR signalling alters proteins involved in cytoskeletal rearrangement and redox control of the cell. We showed that \u03b2AR signalling in macrophages shifts glucose metabolism from glycolysis towards the tricarboxylic acid cycle and pentose phosphate pathways. We also show that \u03b2AR signalling perturbs purine metabolism by accumulating adenylate pools.

Decomposition of lignin-rich wood by fungi drives nutrient recycling in woodland ecosystems. Fluctuating abiotic conditions are known to promote the functioning of ecological communities and ecosystems. In the context of wood decay, fluctuating temperature increases decomposition rates. Metabolomics, in tandem with other \u2018omics tools, can highlight the metabolic processes affected by experimental treatments, even in the absence of genome sequences and annotations. Globally, natural wood decay communities are dominated by the phylum Basidiomycota. We examined the metabolic responses of Mucidula mucida, a dominant constituent of pioneer communities in beech branches in British woodlands, and Exidia glandulosa, a stress-selected constituent of the same communities, in response to constant and diurnally cycling temperature. 2. We applied untargeted metabolomics and proteomics to beech wood blocks, colonised by M. mucida or E. glandulosa and exposed to either diurnally cycling (mean 15 \u00b1 10\u00b0C) or constant (15\u00b0C) temperature, in a fully factorial design. 3. Metabolites and proteins linked to lignin breakdown, the citric acid cycle, pentose phosphate pathway, carbohydrate metabolism, fatty acid metabolism and protein biosynthesis and turnover were under-enriched in fluctuating, compared to stable temperatures, in the generalist M. mucida. Conversely E. glandulosa showed little differential response to the experimental treatments. 4. Synthesis. By demonstrating temperature dependant metabolic signatures related to nutrient acquisition in a generalist wood decay fungus, we provide new insights into how abiotic conditions can affect community-mediated decomposition and carbon turnover in forests. We show that mechanisms underpinning important biogeochemical processes can be highlighted using untargeted metabolomics and proteomics in the absence of well-annotated genomes.","subject_species":"Exidia glandulosa;Mucidula mucida"},"1570":{"study_id":"ST001806","study_title":"Effect of external low-dose rate radiation on mouse biofluid metabolomic signatures (part V)","study_type":"","institute":"Georgetown University","department":"","last_name":"Pannkuk","first_name":"Evan","email":"elp44@georgetown.edu","phone":"2026875650","submit_date":"2021-05-18","study_summary":"An important component of ionizing radiation (IR) exposure after a radiological incident may include low-dose rate (LDR) exposures either externally or internally, such as from 137Cs deposition.

We aimed to characterize the dopaminergic injury and glial activation in the nigrostriatal pathway of mice with transgenic Ptn overexpression in the brain (Ptn-Tg) after intrastriatal injection of the Parkinsonian toxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). The injection of 6-OHDA induced a significant decrease of the number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons in the substantia nigra and of the striatal TH contents in Wild type (Wt) mice. In contrast, these effects of 6-OHDA were blocked in Ptn-Tg mice. 6-OHDA injection did not cause robust changes in microglia but induced an exacerbated astrocytic response in Wt mice compared with Ptn-Tg mice. In metabolomics studies, we detected interesting metabolites that significantly discriminate the more injured 6-OHDA-injected Wt striatum and the more protected 6-OHDA-injected Ptn-Tg striatum. Particularly, we detected groups of metabolites, mostly corresponding to phospholipids, whose trends were opposite in both groups.

Naturally-voided fecal samples were collected from AAD horses (n=17) the day that diarrhea developed and matched to ABX (n=15) and CON (n=31) horses for diet, antimicrobial agent and duration of antimicrobial therapy (&lt; 5 days or &gt; 5 days). Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA genes on fecal DNA was performed. Alpha and beta diversity metrics were generated using QIIME 2.0. A Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn\u2019s post-test and ANOSIM testing was used for statistical analysis. Microbiome composition in AAD was significantly different from CON (ANOSIM, R= 0.568, p=0.001) and ABX (ANOSIM, R=0.121, p=0.0012).

Given that food sources have considerable complexity and contain a wide variety of nutrients (e.g., phenols, anti-oxidants, peptides, amino acids, fatty acids, and other carboxylic acids), the majority of which do not appear on nutrition labels, it is important to explore expanded nutrient profiles when determining whether beef and plant-based meat alternatives are nutritionally interchangeable. Important nutritional differences may exist between beef and novel plant-based alternatives, given their materials origin; however, this has not been thoroughly assessed. Given the scientific and commercial interest in plant-based meat alternatives, the goal of our study was to use untargeted metabolomics to provide an in-depth comparison of the metabolite profiles of grass-fed ground beef and a popular plant-based meat alternative.","subject_species":"-"},"1598":{"study_id":"ST001835","study_title":"Use of Integrated Metabolomics, Transcriptomics, and Signal Protein Profile to Characterize the Effector Function and Associated Metabotype of Polarized Macrophage Phenotypes","study_type":"Ex vivo macrophage polarization metabotyping","institute":"Idaho Veterans Research and Education Foundation","department":"Research","last_name":"Ammons","first_name":"Mary Cloud","email":"MaryCloud.AmmonsAnderson@va.gov","phone":"208-422-1219","submit_date":"2021-06-18","study_summary":"Macrophages (M\u03a6s) display remarkable plasticity and the ability to activate diverse responses to a host of intracellular and external stimuli. Despite extensive characterization of M1 M\u03a6s and a broad set of M2 M\u03a6s, comprehensive characterization of functional phenotype and associated metabotype driving this diverse M\u03a6 activation remains. Herein, we utilized an ex vivo model to produce six M\u03a6 functional phenotypes. Isolated CD14+ PBMCs were differentiated into resting M0 M\u03a6s, and then polarized into M1 (IFN-\u03b3\/LPS), M2a (IL-4\/IL-13), M2b (IC\/LPS), M2c (IL-10), and M2d (IL-6\/LIF) M\u03a6s. The M\u03a6s were profiled using a bioanalyte matrix of four cell surface markers, ~50 secreted proteins, ~800 expressed myeloid genes, and ~450 identified metabolites relative to M0 M\u03a6s. Signal protein and expressed gene profiles grouped the M\u03a6s into inflammatory (M1 and M2b) and wound resolution (M2a, M2c, and M2d) phenotypes; however, each had a unique metabolic profile. While both M1 and M2b M\u03a6s shared metabotype profiles consistent with an inflammatory signature; key differences were observed in the TCA cycle, FAO, and OXPHOS. Additionally, M2a, M2c, and M2d M\u03a6s all profiled as tissue repair M\u03a6s; however, metabotype differences were observed in multiple pathways including hexosamine, polyamine, and fatty acid metabolism.

With emerging evidence that disproves the immune privileged environment in the brain, there is much interest in examining various immunotherapy strategies to treat these incurable cancers. Unfortunately, to date, clinical studies investigating immunotherapy regimens have not provided much evidence of efficacy, leading to questions about the suitability of immunotherapy strategies for these tumors. Inadequate inherent populations of lymphocytes in tumor (TILs) and limited trafficking of systemic circulating T cells into the central nervous system (CNS) likely contribute to the poor response to immunotherapy treatment for primary CNS cancers. This paucity of TILs is in concert with the finding of epigenetic silencing of genes that promote immune cell movement (chemotaxis) to the tumor. In this study we evaluated the ability of GSK126, a blood-brain barrier permeable small molecule inhibitor of EZH2, to reverse the epigenetic silencing of chemokines like CXCL9 and CXCL10. When combined with anti-PD-1 treatment, these IFN driven chemokines promote T cell infiltration, resulting in decreased tumor growth and enhanced survival in immunocompetent murine sub-cutaneous and intracranial tumor syngeneic models of GBM. Examination of the tumor micro-environment revealed that the decrease in tumor growth in the mice treated with the drug combination was accompanied by increased tumor CD8 T cell infiltration along with higher IFN expression. Additionally, a significant increase in CXCR3+ T cells in the draining lymph nodes was also found. Taken together, our data suggests that in glioblastoma, epigenetic modulation using GSK126 could improve current immunotherapy strategies by reversing the epigenetic changes that enable immune cell evasion leading to enhanced immune cell trafficking to the tumor.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"1602":{"study_id":"ST001839","study_title":"Metabolite profiling of Malaysian Gracilaria edulis reveals Eplerenone as novel antibacterial compound for drug repurposing against MDR Bacteria","study_type":"In vitro antibacterial studies","institute":"Sunway University","department":"Biological Sciences, Sunway University, Selangor, Malaysia","last_name":"Lahiri","first_name":"Chandrajit","email":"chandrajitl@sunway.edu.my","phone":"+60 3 7491 8622","submit_date":"2021-04-13","study_summary":"The current study re-defines a method to reveal bioactive compounds from the crude extracts of Malaysian red seaweed Gracilaria edulis, having promising antibacterial activities against selected bacterial species.

Risk factors for NALFD include obesity, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension\u2014all of which are features of metabolic syndrome. NAFLD is a very heterogeneous disease, as it presents in different patterns in males and females and in patients from different ethnicities, with unclear predictors for development and severity of disease. Previous studies have shown that NAFLD is 1.4 times more frequent in Hispanics than in Caucasians. One of the major challenges in NAFLD is the lack of accurate, noninvasive biomarkers for the detection of the most aggressive presentation, NASH. The gold standard for the diagnosis is liver biopsy, which is an invasive procedure associated with possible complications. Noninvasive diagnosis of NASH is a major unmet medical need and there are no ethnicity-specific biomarkers that can diagnose this condition and predict its progression. Therefore, the main gap in knowledge that this proposal and line of research will address is the characterizing the different plasma and liver metabolomics profile of patients with fatty liver from two ethnicities (Latinos vs. Caucasians) and of both sexes.

Rafflesia species are threatened with extinction, making them an iconic symbol of plant conservation. Thus far, propagation has proved challenging, greatly decreasing efficacy of conservation efforts. This study compared the metabolites in the shoots of Rafflesia-infected and non-infected Tetrastigma loheri to examine how Rafflesia infection affects host metabolomics and elucidate the Rafflesia infection process. Results from LC-MS-based untargeted metabolomics analysis showed benzylisoquinoline alkaloids were significantly elevated in non-infected shoots and are here reported for the first time in the genus Tetrastigma, and in the grape family, Vitaceae. These metabolites have been implicated in plant defense mechanisms and may prevent a Rafflesia infection. In Rafflesia-infected shoots, oxygenated fatty acids, or oxylipins, and a flavonoid, previously shown involved in plant immune response, were abundant. This study provides a preliminary assessment of metabolites that differ between Rafflesia-infected and non-infected Tetrastigma hosts and may have applications in Rafflesia propagation to meet conservation goals.","subject_species":"Tetrastigma loheri"},"1618":{"study_id":"ST001855","study_title":"The metabolomic resetting effect of FG4592 in AKI to CKD transition (Part 1)","study_type":"","institute":"Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University","department":"","last_name":"Chen","first_name":"Weiyi","email":"chen.weiyi@qq.com","phone":"0086-25-8311-7309","submit_date":"2021-06-30","study_summary":"C57BL\/6 mice were anesthetized using isoflurane.

Undernourished children display an overabundance of intestinal pathogens and pathobionts, and these bacteria induce enteric dysfunction in undernourished mice; however, the cause of their overgrowth remains poorly defined. Here, we show that disease-inducing human isolates of Enterobacteriaceae and Bacteroidales spp. are capable of multi-species symbiotic cross-feeding, resulting in synergistic growth of a mixed community in vitro. Growth synergy occurs uniquely under malnourished conditions limited in protein and iron: in this context, Bacteroidales spp. liberate diet- and mucin-derived sugars and Enterobacteriaceae spp. enhance the bioavailability of iron. Analysis of human microbiota datasets reveals that Bacteroidaceae and Enterobacteriaceae are strongly correlated in undernourished children, but not in adequately nourished children, consistent with a diet-dependent growth synergy in the human gut.

Transcriptomics analysis of the overly represented differentially expressed genes in the fetal heart of hypercortisolemic ewes indicated involvement of mitochondrial function. Sodium dichloroacetate (DCA) has been used to improve mitochondrial function in several disease states. We hypothesized that administration of DCA to laboring ewes would improve both cardiac mitochondrial activity and cardiac function in their fetuses. Four groups of ewes and their fetuses were studied: control, cortisol-infused (1 g\/kg\/d from 115 to term; CORT), DCA-treated (over 24h) or DCA+CORT-treated; oxytocin was delivered starting 48h before the DCA treatment. DCA significantly decreased cardiac lactate, alanine and glucose\/glucose-6-phosphate and increased acylcarnitine\/isobutyryl-carnitine. DCA increased mitochondrial activity, increasing oxidative phosphorylation (PCI, PCI+II)) per tissue weight or per unit of citrate synthase. DCA also decreased the duration of the QRS, attenuating the prolongation of the QRS observed in CORT fetuses. The effect to reduce QRS duration with DCA treatment correlated with increased glycerophosphocholine and serine and decreased phophocholine after DCA treatment.

Transcriptomics analysis of the overly represented differentially expressed genes in the fetal heart of hypercortisolemic ewes indicated involvement of mitochondrial function. Sodium dichloroacetate (DCA) has been used to improve mitochondrial function in several disease states. We hypothesized that administration of DCA to laboring ewes would improve both cardiac mitochondrial activity and cardiac function in their fetuses. Four groups of ewes and their fetuses were studied: control, cortisol-infused (1 g\/kg\/d from 115 to term; CORT), DCA-treated (over 24h) or DCA+CORT-treated; oxytocin was delivered starting 48h before the DCA treatment. DCA significantly decreased cardiac lactate, alanine and glucose\/glucose-6-phosphate and increased acylcarnitine\/isobutyryl-carnitine. DCA increased mitochondrial activity, increasing oxidative phosphorylation (PCI, PCI+II)) per tissue weight or per unit of citrate synthase. DCA also decreased the duration of the QRS, attenuating the prolongation of the QRS observed in CORT fetuses. The effect to reduce QRS duration with DCA treatment correlated with increased glycerophosphocholine and serine and decreased phophocholine after DCA treatment. There were negative correlations of acylcarnitine\/isobutyryl-carnitine to both HR and MAP. These results suggest that improvements in mitochondrial respiration with DCA produced changes in the cardiac lipid metabolism that favor improved conduction in the heart.

Paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) which strongly inhibit voltage-gated sodium channels in diverse animal taxa are produced by several species of the bloom-forming algal genus Alexandrium where they appear to function as chemical defenses against grazing copepods. Despite PSTs being produced and localized within phytoplankton cells, some copepods distinguish toxic from non-toxic prey, selectively ingesting less toxic cells, in ways that suggest cell surface recognition perhaps associated with non-polar metabolites. In this study LC\/MS and NMR-based metabolomics revealed that the non-polar metabolomes of two toxic species (Alexandrium catenella and Alexandrium pacificum) vary considerably from their non-toxic congener Alexandrium tamarense despite all three being very closely related. Toxic and non-toxic Alexandrium spp. were distinguished from each other by metabolites belonging to seven lipid classes. Of these, 17 specific metabolites were significantly more abundant in both toxic A. catenella and A. pacificum compared to non-toxic A. tamarense suggesting that just a small portion of the observed metabolic variability is associated with toxicity. Future experiments aimed at deciphering chemoreception mechanisms of copepod perception of Alexandrium toxicity should consider these metabolites, and the broader lipid classes phosphatidylcholines and sterols, as potential candidate cues.","subject_species":"Alexandrium catenella;Alexandrium tamarense;Alexandrium pacificum"},"1649":{"study_id":"ST001886","study_title":"Untargeted metabolomics of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (part I)","study_type":"","institute":"Stanford University","department":"","last_name":"Contrepois","first_name":"Kevin","email":"kcontrep@stanford.edu","phone":"6506664538","submit_date":"2021-07-13","study_summary":"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a complex disease partly explained by the effects of individual gene variants on sarcomeric protein biomechanics.

Yet, the complexity of the brain metabolome and its changes during diseases or aging remains poorly understood. To start bridging this gap, we generated a metabolome atlas of the aging wildtype male and female mouse brain from 10 anatomical regions spanning from adolescence to old age. We combined data from three chromatography-based mass spectrometry assays and structurally annotated 1,547 metabolites to reveal the underlying architecture of aging-induced changes in the brain metabolome. Overall differences between sexes were minimal. We found 99% of all metabolites to significantly differ between brain regions in at least one age group. We also discovered that 97% of the metabolome showed significant changes with respect to age groups. For example, we identified a shift in sphingolipid patterns during aging that is related to myelin remodeling in the transition from adolescent to aging brains. This shift was accompanied by large changes in overall signature in a range of other metabolic pathways. We found clear metabolic similarities in brain regions that were functionally related such as brain stem, cerebrum and cerebellum. In cerebrum, metabolic correlation patterns got markedly weaker in the transition from adolescent to adulthood, whereas the overall correlation patterns between all regions reflected a decreased brain segregation at old age. We were also able to map metabolic changes to gene and protein brain atlases to link molecular changes to metabolic brain phenotypes. Metabolic profiles can be investigated via https:\/\/mouse.atlas.metabolomics.us\/.

But the mechanisms underlying the evolution of suspended animation states are unknown. The African turquoise killifish has evolved diapause as a form of suspended development to survive the complete drought that occurs every summer. Here, we show that gene duplicates \u2013 paralogs \u2013 exhibit specialized expression in diapause compared to normal development in the African turquoise killifish. Surprisingly, paralogs with specialized expression in diapause are evolutionarily very ancient and are present even in vertebrates that do not exhibit diapause. To determine if evolution of diapause is due to the regulatory landscape rewiring at ancient paralogs, we assessed chromatin accessibility genome-wide in fish species with or without diapause. This analysis revealed an evolutionary recent increase in chromatin accessibility at very ancient paralogs in African turquoise killifish. The increase in chromatin accessibility is linked to the presence of new binding sites for transcription factors, likely due to de novo mutations and transposable element (TE) insertion. Interestingly, accessible chromatin regions in diapause are enriched for lipid metabolism genes, and our lipidomics studies uncover a striking difference in lipid species in African turquoise killifish diapause, which could be critical for long-term survival. Together, our results show that diapause likely originated by repurposing pre-existing gene programs via recent changes in the regulatory landscape. This work raises the possibility that suspended animation programs could be reactivated in other species for long-term preservation via transcription factor remodeling and suggests a mechanism for how complex adaptations evolve in nature.","subject_species":"Nothobranchius furzeri;Aphyosemion striatum"},"1662":{"study_id":"ST001899","study_title":"Systemic host inflammation induces stage-specific transcriptomic modification and slower maturation in malaria parasites (part I)","study_type":"Study part 1 of 2 (independent experiment 1)","institute":"QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute","department":"Cell & Molecular Biology Department","last_name":"Stoll","first_name":"Thomas","email":"thomas.stoll@qimrberghofer.edu.au","phone":"+61 7 3845 3992","submit_date":"2021-08-09","study_summary":"Previous reports suggest that the maturation rate of malaria parasites within red blood cells (RBC) is not constant for a given species in vivo.

However, increasing evidence suggests that elevated amino acids cause cellular toxicity associated with numerous metabolic disorders. How cells cope with elevated amino acids remains poorly understood. Here, we show that a previously identified cellular structure, the mitochondrial-derived compartment (MDC), functions to protect cells from amino acid stress. In response to amino acid elevation, MDCs are generated from mitochondria, where they selectively sequester and deplete SLC25A nutrient carriers and their associated import receptor Tom70 from the organelle. Generation of MDCs promotes amino acid catabolism, and their formation occurs simultaneously with transporter removal at the plasma membrane via the multi-vesicular body (MVB) pathway. Combined loss of vacuolar amino acid storage, MVBs and MDCs renders cells sensitive to high amino acid stress. Thus, we propose that MDCs operate as part of a coordinated cell network that facilitates amino acid homoeostasis through post-translational nutrient transporter remodeling.","subject_species":"Saccharomyces cerevisiae"},"1665":{"study_id":"ST001902","study_title":"Metabolomics analysis of AsPC-1 PDAC cells treated with Porcupine inhibitor (LGK974)","study_type":"","institute":"University of California, Los Angeles","department":"Pathology & Laboratory Medicine","last_name":"Dawson","first_name":"David","email":"ddawson@mednet.ucla.edu","phone":"310-825-0618","submit_date":"2021-07-19","study_summary":"WNT signaling promotes pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) through diverse effects on proliferation, differentiation, survival, and stemness.

The objective of this study was to determine if perturbations in gut microbial composition and the gut metabolome could be linked to individuals with obesity and osteoarthritis (OA). Methods. Fecal samples were collected from obese individuals diagnosed with radiographic hand plus knee OA (n=59), defined as involvement of at least 3 joints across both hands, and a Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade 2-4 (or total knee replacement) in at least one knee. Controls (n=33) were without hand OA and with KL grade 0-1 knees. Fecal metabolomes were analyzed by a UHPLC\/Q Exactive HFx mass spectrometer. Microbiome composition was determined in fecal samples by 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing (rRNA-seq). Stepwise logistic regression models were built to determine microbiome and\/or metabolic characteristics of OA. Results. Untargeted metabolomics analysis indicated that OA cases had significantly higher levels of di- and tri-peptides and significant perturbations in microbial metabolites including propionic acid, indoles and other tryptophan metabolites. Pathway analysis revealed several significantly perturbed pathways associated with OA including leukotriene metabolism, amino acid metabolism and fatty acid utilization. Logistic regression models selected metabolites associated with the gut microbiota and leaky gut syndrome as significant predictors of OA status, particularly when combined with the rRNA-seq data. Conclusions. Adults with obesity and OA have distinct fecal metabolomes characterized by increased products of proteolysis, perturbations in leukotriene metabolism, and changes in microbial metabolites compared with controls.

Herein, we hypothesized that exposure to ECs, particularly perfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS), impacts liver metabolism, specifically bile acid metabolism. Methods: In a well-characterized human NAFLD cohort of 105 individuals, we investigated the effects of EC exposure on liver metabolism. We characterized the liver (via biopsy) and circulating metabolomes using four mass spectrometry-based analytical platforms, and measured PFAS and other ECs in serum. We subsequently compared these results with an exposure study in a PPARa-humanized mouse model. Results: PFAS exposure appears associated with perturbation of key hepatic metabolic pathways previously found altered in NAFLD, particularly as regards bile acid metabolism. Specifically, we identified stronger associations between the liver metabolome, chemical exposure and NAFLD-associated clinical variables in female subjects versus males. The murine exposure study further corroborated our findings, vis-\u00e0-vis a sex-specific association between PFAS exposure and NAFLD-associated lipid changes. Conclusions: Females may be more sensitive to the harmful impacts of PFAS. Lipid-related changes subsequent to PFAS exposure may be secondary to the interplay between PFAS and bile acid metabolism.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"1683":{"study_id":"ST001920","study_title":"Metabolic and lipidomic characterization of radioresistant MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells to investigate potential therapeutic targets","study_type":"","institute":"ChungAng University","department":"College of Pharmacy","last_name":"Lee","first_name":"Hwanhui","email":"hwanhui56@gmail.com","phone":"+8228205605","submit_date":"2021-09-22","study_summary":"To provide preliminary insights into metabolic and lipidomic characteristics in radioresistant triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells and suggest potential therapeutic targets, we performed a comprehensive metabolic and lipidomic profiling of radioresistant MDA-MB-231 (MDA-MB-231\/RR) TNBC cells and their parental cells using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and nano electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry, followed by multivariate statistical analysis.

Previous research has highlighted that a sublytic dose of MAC can initiate NLRP3 inflammasome activation via calcium influx and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Here, we show that sublytic concentrations of MAC mediate a previously undescribed perturbation in cellular energy metabolism in human monocyte-derived macrophages, by phenotypic skewing towards glycolysis and upregulation of glycolysis-promoting genes. Sublytic MAC concentrations drive mitochondrial dysfunction, characterised by a fragmented mitochondrial morphology, loss of maximal respiratory response, depleted mitochondrial membrane potential as well as increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production. The consequences of these alterations in glycolytic metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction lead to NLRP3 inflammasome activation, driving gasdermin D formation and IL-18 release. This novel link between sublytic MAC and immunometabolism, with direct consequences for downstream inflammatory processes, is important for development of novel therapeutics for areas where MAC may mediate disease.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"1686":{"study_id":"ST001923","study_title":"Urine-Based Metabolomics and Machine Learning Reveals Metabolites Associated with Renal Cell Carcinoma Progression","study_type":"","institute":"University of Georgia","department":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology","last_name":"Bifarin","first_name":"Olatomiwa","email":"olatomiwa.bifarin25@uga.edu","phone":"757-405-4379","submit_date":"2021-08-16","study_summary":"Every year, hundreds of thousands of cases of renal carcinoma (RCC) are reported worldwide.

After contact with the insect, the entomopathogenic fungus penetrates its body cavity, where it grows and colonizes it from within, causing its death The use of two or more microorganisms in a microbial consortium has been increasingly applied in the biological control of diseases and pests. Beauveria bassiana is one of the most widely studied fungal species in biological control, yet little is known about its role in fungal consortiums. In a previous study, our group found that a consortium formed by two strains of B. bassiana had significantly greater biocontrol potential against the polyphagous caterpillars Duponchelia fovealis (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) than either strain on its own. Despite recent developments and growing efforts to better understand fungal metabolism and metabolites, much remains unknown. Metabolomics therefore represents an important field for evaluating the metabolites produced or modified by an organism or its relationship with the environment. In the present study, we aim to use untargeted metabolomics with gas and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometers (GC-MS and LC-MS\/MS) to evaluate the metabolic alterations caused by the co-cultivation of these strains and to correlate the metabolites produced by this consortium with the increased mortality in D. fovealis observed previosly.","subject_species":"Beauveria bassiana"},"1691":{"study_id":"ST001928","study_title":"Metabolomics profiles of premenopausal women are different based on O-desmethylangolensin metabotype","study_type":"","institute":"George Mason University","department":"","last_name":"Frankenfeld","first_name":"Cara","email":"prof.frankenfeld@gmail.com","phone":"206-265-2563","submit_date":"2021-08-20","study_summary":"Urinary O-desmethylangolensin (ODMA) concentrations provide a functional gut microbiome marker of dietary isoflavone daidzein metabolism to ODMA.

To investigate biological response mechanisms underlying exposure to traffic related pollutants, we used an integrated molecular response approach that included high-resolution metabolomic profiling and peripheral blood gene expression to identify biological responses to diesel exhaust exposure. Plasma samples were collected from 73 non-smoking males employed in the US trucking industry between February 2009 and October 2010 and analyzed using untargeted high-resolution metabolomics to characterize association with shift- and week-averaged levels of elemental carbon (EC), organic carbon (OC) and particulate matter with diameter \u2264 2.5 \u03bcm (PM2.5). Annotated metabolites associated with exposure were then tested for relationships with the peripheral blood transcriptome using multivariate selection and network correlation. Week-averaged EC and OC levels, which were averaged across multiple shifts during the workweek, resulted in the greatest exposure-associated metabolic alterations compared to shift-averaged exposure levels. Metabolic changes associated with EC exposure suggest increased lipid peroxidation products, biomarkers of oxidative stress, thrombotic signaling lipids, and metabolites associated with endothelial dysfunction from altered nitric oxide metabolism, while OC exposures were associated with antioxidants, oxidative stress biomarkers and critical intermediates in nitric oxide production. Correlation with whole blood RNA gene expression provided additional evidence of changes in processes related to endothelial function, immune response, inflammation, and oxidative stress. We did not detect metabolic associations with PM2.5. This study provides an integrated molecular assessment of human exposure to traffic-related air pollutants that includes diesel exhaust.

Together, these results demonstrate at community and molecular levels how the capybara gut microbiota orchestrates the deconstruction and utilization of dietary fibers, representing an untapped reservoir of new and intricate enzymatic mechanisms to overcome the lignocellulose recalcitrance, a central challenge toward a bio-based and sustainable economy.","subject_species":"Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris"},"1709":{"study_id":"ST001946","study_title":"Bipolar disorder metabolomics analysis using FiehnLib and GMD for curation","study_type":"Untargeted GC analysis","institute":"University of Campinas","department":"Chemistry Institute, Department of Analytical Chemistry","last_name":"Ribeiro","first_name":"Henrique","email":"hcarachoribeiro@gmail.com","phone":"+55 19 3521 3018","submit_date":"2021-10-11","study_summary":"In this study we analyzed the blood serum from 14 controls and 14 BD patients using GC-MS under the conditions required for the use of FiehnLib library with GMD as secondary library for curation on a untargeted metabolomics approach","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"1710":{"study_id":"ST001947","study_title":"Metabolite profiling of shoots of juvenile maize plants","study_type":"Metabolic diversity analysis","institute":"University of Nebraska-Lincoln","department":"Biochemistry","last_name":"Obata","first_name":"Toshihiro","email":"tobata2@unl.edu","phone":"(402)472-3762","submit_date":"2021-10-13","study_summary":"Profiles of primary metabolites in the shoots of juvenile maize inbred lines in the Goodman association panel were analyzed by GC-TOFMS to identify genetic components associated with metabolic control and plant performance.

Machine learning and feature selection approaches were used to construct lipid panels capable of distinguishing serum from injured and uninjured animals across a range of injury severities and timepoints within the first day of injury. The best multivariate lipid panels had over 90% cross-validated sensitivity, selectivity, and accuracy and consisted of species from nine different lipid classes.

Here, we report that histone H3-mediated Cu1+ toxicity is a major determinant of cellular functional pool of Fe-S clusters. Inadequate Fe-S cluster supply, either due to diminished assembly as occurs in Friedreich\u2019s Ataxia or defective distribution, causes severe metabolic and growth defects in S. cerevisiae. Decreasing Cu1+ abundance, through attenuation of histone cupric reductase activity or depletion of total cellular copper, restored Fe-S cluster-dependent metabolism and growth.

We hypothesize that additional genetic modifiers, potentially including genetic loci relevant to mesencephalic dopamine neuron development may play a role. We differentiated human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) derived from SM and PM into mitotically active mesencephalic neural precursor cells and early postmitotic dopaminergic neurons and performed whole exome sequencing, transcriptomic- and metabolomic analyses. No significant differences in canonical markers of differentiation were observed between SM and PM. Yet our transcriptomic analysis revealed a significant down regulation of three neurodevelopmentally relevant cell adhesion molecules, CNTN6, CNTN4 and CHL1 in PM- compared to SM cultures on days 11 and 25 of differentiation. In addition, several HLA genes, known to play a role in neurodevelopment, independent of their well-established function in immunity, were differentially regulated in PM and SM developing dopamine neurons. EN2, a transcription factor crucial for mesencephalic dopamine neuron development, was also differentially regulated.

In patients, THEM6 expression correlates with progressive disease and is associated with poor survival. THEM6 deletion reduces in vivo tumour growth and restores castration sensitivity in orthograft models of CRPC. Mechanistically, THEM6 is located at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and controls lipid homeostasis by regulating intracellular levels of ether lipids. As a consequence, THEM6 loss in CRPC cells significantly alters ER function, preventing lipid-mediated induction of ATF4 and reducing de novo sterol biosynthesis. Finally, we show that THEM6 is required for the establishment of the MYC-induced stress response. Thus, similar to PCa, THEM6 loss significantly impairs tumorigenesis in the MYC-dependent subtype of triple negative breast cancer.

The prevalence of NAFLD is rapidly increasing worldwide, while the pathology and the underlying mechanisms driving NAFLD are not fully understood.

However, the alteration of the metabolic pathways in the human liver along the progression of NAFLD, i.e., the transition from nonalcoholic steatosis (NAFL) to steatohepatitis (NASH) through cirrhosis remains to be discovered. Here, we sought to examine the metabolic pathways of the human liver across the full histological spectrum of NAFLD. We analyzed the whole liver tissue transcriptomic (RNA-Seq) and serum metabolomics data obtained from a large, prospectively enrolled cohort of histologically characterized patients derived from the European NAFLD Registry (n=206), and developed genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) of human hepatocytes at different stages of NAFLD. The integrative approach employed in this study has enabled us to understand the regulation of the metabolic pathways of human liver in NAFL, and with progressive NASH-associated fibrosis (F0\u2013F4). Our study identified several metabolic signatures in the liver and blood of these patients, specifically highlighting the alteration of vitamins (A, E) and glycosphingolipids (GSLs), and their link with complex glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in advanced fibrosis. The study provides insights into the underlying pathways of the progressive fibrosing steatohepatitis. Furthermore, by applying genome-scale metabolic modeling (GSMM), we were able to identify the metabolic differences among carriers of widely validated genetic variants associated with NAFLD \/ NASH disease severity in three genes (PNPLA3, TM6SF2 and HSD17B13).","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"1728":{"study_id":"ST001965","study_title":"Integration of Metabolomics and Proteomics to Unveil Orchestration of Photorespiration and Central Carbon Pathway in Microchloropsis gaditana NIES 2587","study_type":"Time Course VLC HC Metabolome","institute":"International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology","department":"Integrative Biotechnology","last_name":"Jutur","first_name":"Pavan","email":"jppavan@gmail.com","phone":"01126741358","submit_date":"2021-08-30","study_summary":"Photosynthetic organisms have evolved and adapted strategies to overcome the limiting concentrations of CO2.

Determine the likely metabolic differences between antimicrobially challenged and unchallenged growth and wild type and antimicrobially mutated Bacillus cereus (B. cereus) samples by using NMR hydrophilic metabolomics. Proton (1H) NMR hydrophilic metabolite analysis was conducted using B. cereus wild type and B. cereus that was mutated with C16-DABCO and mannose functionalized poly(amidoamine) dendrimers (DABCOMD). Both the wild type and the mutated sample types were grown in low levels of DABCOMD (challenged samples) or without the addition of DABCOMD to the growth media (unchallenged samples) for sample collection at the mid log and stationary phases and for growth curve procurement. Hierarchical clustering of only the challenged sample type showed that both the stationary phase sample types (mutant and wild type) clustered together while the both the mid log phase sample types were distinct. Hierarchical clustering of the unchallenged samples showed complete separation of all sample types. There were statistically significant (p-value and fold change) changes in the concentrations of metabolites in both energy related pathways and peptidoglycan synthesis between all sample types, especially with mutants and especially the challenged sample types have more N-acetylglucosamine (as much as a 94.2-fold increase). The mid log phase sample types showed a larger difference between sample types than their stationary phase counter parts. The challenged and unchallenged mutant samples showed a larger difference between sample types in comparison to the differences between the challenged and unchallenged wild type sample types. There was a larger metabolite difference when comparing the challenged mutant samples to the challenged wild type samples than when comparing the unchallenged mutant samples to the unchallenged wild type samples. The metabolomic analysis of wild type and multivalent DABCOMD mutated B. cereus under both challenged and unchallenged conditions indicated that the mutants, especially the challenged mutants, are likely changing their peptidoglycan layer to protect themselves from the high positive charge on the membrane disrupting DABCOMD. This membrane fortification most likely led to the slow growth curve of the mutated and especially the challenged mutant samples. The association of these sample types with metabolites associated with energy expenditure is attributed to the increased energy required for these changes to occur as well as to the decreased diffusion of nutrients across the membrane.","subject_species":"Bacillus cereus"},"1730":{"study_id":"ST001967","study_title":"Analytical methodology for a metabolome atlas of goat\u2019s plasma, milk and feces using 1H-NMR and UHPLC-HRMS:NMR\/plasma","study_type":"","institute":"INSERM","department":"INSERM","last_name":"Martias","first_name":"Cecile","email":"cecile.martias@univ-tours.fr","phone":"0247366351","submit_date":"2021-09-27","study_summary":"Metabolomics has been increasingly used in animal and food sciences.

In this study, metabolites characteristically contained in the saliva of individuals with good oral hygiene were determined, after which the effects of an identified prebiotic candidate, D-tagatose, on phenotype, gene expression, and metabolic profiles of those three key bacterial species were investigated. Examinations of the saliva metabolome of 18 systemically healthy volunteers identified salivary D-tagatose as associated with lower dental biofilm abundance in the oral cavity (Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficient; r = -0.603, p = 0.008), then the effects of D-tagatose on oral streptococci were analyzed in vitro. In chemically defined medium (CDM) containing D-tagatose as the sole carbohydrate source, S. mutans and S. gordonii each showed negligible biofilm formation, whereas significant biofilms were formed in cultures of S. oralis. Furthermore, even in the presence of glucose, S. mutans and S. gordonii showed growth suppression and decreases in the final viable cell count in a D-tagatose concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, no inhibitory effects of D-tagatose on the growth of S. oralis were observed. To investigate species-specific inhibition by D-tagatose, the metabolomic profiles of D-tagatose-treated S. mutans, S. gordonii, and S. oralis cells were examined. The intracellular amounts of pyruvate-derived amino acids in S. mutans and S. gordonii, but not in S. oralis, such as branched-chain amino acids and alanine, tended to decrease in the presence of D-tagatose. This phenomenon indicates that D-tagatose inhibits growth of those bacteria by affecting glycolysis and its downstream metabolism. In conclusion, the present study provides evidence that D-tagatose is abundant in saliva of individuals with good oral health. Additionally, experimental results demonstrated that D-tagatose selectively inhibits growth of the oral pathogens S. mutans and S. gordonii. In contrast, the oral commensal S. oralis seemed to be negligibly affected, thus highlighting the potential of administration of D-tagatose as an oral prebiotic for its ability to manipulate the metabolism of those targeted oral streptococci.","subject_species":"Streptococcus gordonii DL1 Challis \/ Streptococcus mutans UA159 \/ Streptococcus oralis ATCC9811"},"1744":{"study_id":"ST001981","study_title":"Non-destructive characterization of Mesenchymal stem cells","study_type":"","institute":"University of Georgia","department":"","last_name":"Shen","first_name":"Xunan","email":"xs41379@uga.edu","phone":"7858407009","submit_date":"2021-09-16","study_summary":"Culture media from the growth of three different MSC cell lines (two bone marrow, one iPSC) were sampled daily for NMR metabolomics analysis.

An overall increase in the metabolites associated with aerobic glycolysis and phospholipid metabolism were observed in the majority of the cancer cells. A preponderant increase in the levels of metabolites involved in trans-sulfuration and glutathione synthesis was also observed. Subsets of HGSOC cells showed an increase in the levels of 5-Hydroxytryptamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, or glutamate, pointing to their potential role as oncometabolites. In summary, our results identify increased glycolysis, phospholipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism with the resultant increase in the levels of 5-Hydoxytryptamine, GABA, and Glutamate as metabolomic correlates underlying the heterogeneity of ovarian cancer cell lines.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"1747":{"study_id":"ST001984","study_title":"Metabolic adaptations in an endocrine-related breast cancer mouse model unveil potential markers of tumor response to hormonal therapy","study_type":"case - control study","institute":"University of Aveiro","department":"Chemistry","last_name":"Silva","first_name":"Ana","email":"anarita.asilva@ua.pt","phone":"234370200","submit_date":"2021-10-06","study_summary":"Breast cancer (BC) is the most common type of cancer in women and, in most cases, it is hormone-dependent (HD), thus relying on ovarian hormone activation of intracellular receptors to stimulate tumor growth.

This involves the development of hormone independent tumors that initially are ET-responsive (HI), which may subsequently become resistant (HIR). The mechanisms that promote the conversion of HI to HIR tumors are varied and not completely understood. The aim of this work was to characterize the metabolic adaptations accompanying this conversion through the analysis of the polar metabolomes of tumor tissue and non-compromised mammary gland from mice implanted subcutaneously with HD, HI and HIR tumors from a medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA)-induced BC mouse model. This was carried out by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of tissue polar extracts and data mining through multivariate and univariate statistical analysis. Initial results unveiled marked changes between global tumor profiles and non-compromised mammary gland tissues, as expected. More importantly, specific metabolic signatures were found to accompany progression from HD, through HI and to HIR tumors, impacting on amino acids, nucleotides, membrane percursors and metabolites related to oxidative stress protection mechanisms. For each transition, sets of polar metabolites are advanced as potential markers of progression, including acquisition of resistance to ET. Putative biochemical interpretation of such signatures are proposed and discussed.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"1748":{"study_id":"ST001985","study_title":"Profiling Plasmodium falciparum parasites and human red blood cells after treatment with MMV693183","study_type":"","institute":"Pennsylvania State University","department":"","last_name":"Llin\u00e1s","first_name":"Manuel","email":"manuel@psu.edu","phone":"8148673527","submit_date":"2021-10-26","study_summary":"Compound MMV693183 was added to either Plasmodium falciparum or uninfected red blood cells.

Although Fbxo7 is an F-box protein that recruits substrates for SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligases, it also promotes the formation of cyclin D\/Cdk6\/p27 complexes in an E3-ligase independent fashion. We discovered PFKP, the major gatekeeper of glycolysis, in a screen for Fbxo7 substrates. PFKP has been previously shown to be a critical substrate of Cdk6 for the viability of T-ALL cells experiencing high levels of reactive oxygen species. We investigated the molecular relationships between Fbxo7, Cdk6 and PFKP, and the functional effect Fbxo7 has on T cell metabolism, viability, and activation. Fbxo7 promotes Cdk6-independent ubiquitination and Cdk6-dependent phosphorylation of PFKP. Importantly Fbxo7-deficient cells have reduced Cdk6 activity, and haematopoietic and lymphocytic cell lines show a significant dependency on Fbxo7. CD4+ T cells with reduced Fbxo7 have increased glycolysis, and lower cell viability and activation levels. Metabolomic studies of activated CD4+ T cells confirm increased glycolytic flux in Fbxo7-deficient cells, as well as altered nucleotide biosynthesis and arginine metabolism. We show Fbxo7 expression is glucose-responsive, and we propose Fbxo7 inhibits PFKP and glycolysis via its activation of Cdk6.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"1750":{"study_id":"ST001987","study_title":"Transcriptomic and lipidomic analysis unravels the response of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii to calcium palmitate","study_type":"","institute":"University of Groningen","department":"","last_name":"Horvatovich","first_name":"P\u00e9ter","email":"p.l.horvatovich@rug.nl","phone":"+31 (0)50 363 3341","submit_date":"2021-11-12","study_summary":"Infant formula is a suggested alternative to human milk if breastfeeding is not an option; vegetable oil blends are commonly used in infant formula (IF) to replace dairy fat, which can induce the formation of the poorly soluble soap calcium palmitate (CP) in the infant\u2019s gut.

However, the molecular interaction between the fungal consortium and the caterpillars is unknown, raising several questions about the enhanced pest control observed. Furthermore, concerns over the emergency of resistance and the selection for resistance to chemical and biological products that are constantly applied in agriculture highlight the need for careful examination of novel pest control methods. Thus, in this work, we sought to pioneer the evaluation of the molecular interaction between a fungal consortium of B. bassiana and D. fovealis caterpillars.

Recently, darobactin A, a novel bicyclic heptapeptide that selectively kills Gram-negative bacteria by targeting the outer-membrane protein BamA, was discovered. Its efficacy was proven in animal infection models of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, thus promoting darobactin A as a promising lead compound. Originally discovered from members of the nematode symbiotic genus Photorhabdus, the biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) encoding for the synthesis of darobactin A can also be found in other \u03b3-proteobacterial families. Therein, the precursor peptides DarB-F, which differ in their core sequence from darobactin A, were identified in silico. Even though production of these analogs was not observed in the putative producer strains, we were able to generate them by mutasynthetic derivatization of a heterologous expression system. The generated analogs were isolated and tested for their bioactivity. The most potent compound, darobactin B, was used for co-crystallization with the target BamA, revealing an identical binding site to darobactin A.

Recently, darobactin A, a novel bicyclic heptapeptide that selectively kills Gram-negative bacteria by targeting the outer-membrane protein BamA, was discovered. Its efficacy was proven in animal infection models of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, thus promoting darobactin A as a promising lead compound. Originally discovered from members of the nematode symbiotic genus Photorhabdus, the biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) encoding for the synthesis of darobactin A can also be found in other \u03b3-proteobacterial families. Therein, the precursor peptides DarB-F, which differ in their core sequence from darobactin A, were identified in silico. Even though production of these analogs was not observed in the putative producer strains, we were able to generate them by mutasynthetic derivatization of a heterologous expression system. The generated analogs were isolated and tested for their bioactivity. The most potent compound, darobactin B, was used for co-crystallization with the target BamA, revealing an identical binding site to darobactin A. Besides its potency, darobactin B did not exhibit cytotoxicity and was slightly more active against Acinetobacter baumanii isolates than darobactin A.

Dissolved GBT had maximum uptake rates of 0.36 and 0.56 nM hr -1 and half-saturation constants of 79 and 11 nM in the high nitrate and low nitrate stations, respectively. GBT taken into cells was predominantly retained as an untransformed compatible solute. A portion of GBT was transformed into other metabolites, through characterized and uncharacterized pathways. Where nitrate was scarce, GBT was primarily catabolized via the demethylation to glycine. Resulting metabolites were used to build protein biomass, and remineralized ammonia was re-assimilated into cells. Gene expression data from this region show that bacteria, especially SAR11, are the dominant organisms expressing the demethylation genes.

High-resolution magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (HRMAS-NMR) was used for untargeted metabolomics and data acquisition followed by a machine learning (ML) approach for the analyses of large metabolic datasets. Crossvalidation of ML predicted NMR spectral features was done by statistical methods (Wilcoxon-test) using JMP-pro16 software. Alanine was identified as the most critical metabolite with potential to detect glioma with precision of 1.0, recall of 0.96, and F1 measure of 0.98. The top 10 metabolites identified for glioma detection included alanine, glutamine, valine, methionine, N-acetylaspartate (NAA), \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA), serine, \u03b1-glucose, lactate, and arginine. We achieved 100% accuracy for the detection of glioma using ML algorithms, extra tree classifier, and random forest, and 98% accuracy with logistic regression. Classification of glioma in low and high grades was done with 86% accuracy using logistic regression model, and with 83% and 79% accuracy using extra tree classifier and random forest, respectively. The predictive accuracy of our ML model is superior to any of the previously reported algorithms, used in tissue- or liquid biopsy-based metabolic studies.

Former studies already have shown that microorganisms may modulate plant metabolism. To further investigate the potential interaction between A. tinctoria and associated microorganisms we performed a greenhouse experiment, in which A. tinctoria plants were grown in the presence of three distinct soil microbiomes. At four defined plant developmental stages we made an in-depth assessment of bacterial and fungal root-associated microbiomes as well as all primary and secondary metabolites. Our results showed that the plant developmental stage was the most important driver influencing the plant metabolite content, revealing peak contents of alkannin\/shikonin at the fruiting stage. In contrast, the soil microbiome had the biggest impact on the plant root microbiome. Correlation analyses performed on the measured metabolite content and the abundance of individual bacterial and fungal taxa suggested a dynamic, at times positive or negative relationship between root-associated microorganisms and root metabolism.

Metabolome coverage from non-targeted LC-MS studies relies heavily on the pre-analytical protocols (e.g., homogenization and extraction) used. Chosen protocols impact which metabolites are successfully measured, which in turn impacts biological conclusions. Different homogenization and extraction methods produce significant variability in metabolome coverage, sample reproducibility, and extraction efficiency. Herein we describe an efficient Taguchi method design of experiments (DOE) approach to optimize the extraction solvent and volume, extraction time, and LC reconstitution solvent for a sequential non-polar and polar Caenorhabditis elegans extraction. DOE is rarely used in metabolomics yet provides a systematic approach for optimizing sample preparation while simultaneously decreasing the number of experiments required to obtain high-quality data.","subject_species":"Caenorhabditis elegans"},"1807":{"study_id":"ST002047","study_title":"Lyso-lipid induced oligodendrocytes maturation underlie restoration of optic nerve function","study_type":"","institute":"University of Miami","department":"","last_name":"Bhattacharya","first_name":"Sanjoy K.","email":"sbhattacharya@med.miami.edu","phone":"3054824103","submit_date":"2021-12-16","study_summary":"Protein hyper-deimination and deficiency of lyso-phospholipids (LPC 18:1) has been associated with the pathology of demyelinating disease in both humans and mice.

Our in vitro studies show LPC 18:1 protection against neuron-ectopic hyper-deimination and stimulation of oligodendrocyte maturation, while in vivo investigations recorded optic nerve function improvement following optic nerve injections of LPC 18:1, in contrast to LPC 18:0. Thus just a change in a single bond renders a dramatic alternation in biological function. The incorporation of isobaric C13-histidine in newly synthesized myelin proteins and quantitative proteome shifts are consistent with remyelination underlying restoration in optic nerve function. These results suggest that exogenous LPC 18:1 may provide a therapeutic avenue for stemming vision loss in demyelinating diseases.","subject_species":"Rattus norvegicus"},"1808":{"study_id":"ST002049","study_title":"Perfluoroalkyl Compounds and Child Metabolic Health - Healthy Start Cohort","study_type":"Untargeted LC-MS Metabolomics Study","institute":"University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus","department":"Anschutz Medical Campus","last_name":"Perng","first_name":"Wei","email":"Wei.Perng@CUAnschutz.edu","phone":"734-717-0982","submit_date":"2021-12-22","study_summary":"Healthy Start is a prospective, pre-birth cohort study that recruited pregnant participants from outpatient prenatal clinics at the University of Colorado Hospital between 2009 and 2014.

While these dipeptides exhibit multifunctional properties, a composite understanding of their roles in myocardium is lacking. To identify the landscape of histidyl dipeptide mediated responses in the heart, we used a triomics approach of genome wide RNA sequencing, global proteomics and unbiased metabolomics in the cardio specific Carns transgenic (Tg) mice and integrated the three data sets. Our result show higher myocardial levels of histidyl dipeptides lead to extensive changes in several microRNAs, which could target the expression of contractile proteins, beta-fatty acid oxidation and citric acid cycle (TCA) enzymes. Global proteomics shows, expression of contractile proteins, enzymes of beta-fatty acid oxidation and TCA cycle, were enriched in the CarnsTg heart. Under aerobic conditions, the CarnsTg hearts had lower levels of short and long-chain fatty acids and TCA cycle intermediate-succinic acid, whereas, under ischemic conditions the accumulation of fatty acids and TCA cycle intermediates were significantly attenuated in the CarnsTg heart. Integration of multiple data sets suggests that beta-fatty acid oxidation and TCA cycle pathways exhibited correlative changes in the CarnsTg hearts at all three levels.

Plasma samples were analyzed using untargeted lipidomics and metabolomics. Endotoxin increased circulating serum amyloid A, LPS-binding protein, and cortisol concentrations. Endotoxin administration decreased plasma lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) concentrations and increased select plasma ceramide concentrations. These outcomes suggest modulation of the immune response and insulin action. Lipopolysaccharide decreased the ratio of phosphatidylcholine to phosphatidylethanomanine, which potentially indicate a decrease in the hepatic activation of phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase and triglyceride export. Endotoxin administration also increased plasma concentrations of pyruvic and lactic acids, and decreased plasma citric acid concentrations, which implicate the upregulation of glycolysis and downregulation of the citric acid cycle (i.e., the Warburg effect), potentially in leukocytes.

Here, in CHCHD10 knock-in mutant mice, we identify an extensive cardiac metabolic rewiring triggered by proteotoxic ISRmt. The stress response arises early on, before the onset of bioenergetic impairments, triggering a switch from oxidative to glycolytic metabolism, enhancement of transsulfuration and one carbon (1C) metabolism, and widespread metabolic imbalance. In parallel, increased NADPH oxidases elicit antioxidant responses leading to heme depletion.

Here, we elucidated the metabolome of H9c2 cardioblasts by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry during ferroptosis induced by RSL3, a GPX4 inhibitor, in the presence of ferrostatin-1 (a ferroptosis inhibitor), XJB-5-131 (a mitochondrial-targeted ROS scavenger), or TSM-1005-44 (a newly developed cellular ROS scavenger). Results demonstrated that RSL3 decreased the levels of amino acids involved in glutathione synthesis more than two-fold. In contrast, saturated fatty acids levels were markedly increased in RSL3-challenged cells, with no effects on unsaturated fatty acids. RSL3 significantly altered the levels of mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates; isocitrate and 2-oxoglutarate were found to increase, whereas succinate was significantly decreased in RSL3-challenged cells. Ferrostatin-1, XJB-5-131, and TSM-1005-44 prevented RSL3-induced cell death and conserved the metabolomic profile of the cells. Since 2-oxoglutarate is involved in the regulation of ferroptosis, particularly through glutamine metabolism, we further assessed the role of glutaminolysis in ferroptosis in H9c2 cardioblasts. Genetic silencing of GLS1, which encodes the K-type mitochondrial glutaminase (glutaminase C), protected against ferroptosis in the early stage.

Here, we describe a comprehensive longitudinal lipidomic profiling approach aiming to provide new physiological insights into aging, diabetes, inflammation, and cytokine regulations. By profiling the plasma lipidome to a depth of more than 800 lipid species across 1,546 samples collected from 109 subjects spanning up to 9 years (3.2 average), we identified a myriad of dysregulated lipid species highly associated with transitions from health to disease. Our data suggest distinct physiological roles of complex lipid subclasses including large and small triacylglycerols (TAG), ester- and ether-linked phosphatidylethanolamines (PE), lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC), and lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE). The dynamic changes in the plasma lipidome under the conditions of respiratory viral infections, insulin resistance (IR), and aging indicate a putative role of these different lipids in regulating immune homeostasis in health as well as in acute and chronic inflammation. Moreover, metabolically unhealthy subjects diagnosed with IR show (1) disturbed immune homeostasis and differences in specific lipid-clinical measure associations, (2) altered dynamics for particular complex lipids including TAGs, LPCs PEs, and PCs in response to acute infections, and (3) elevated levels of complex lipids such as TAGs and CEs and accelerated aging, highlighting the importance of context specific interpretation of lipid profiles. Overall, our study exemplifies the power of deep and quantitative lipidomics profiling in conjunction with other omics measures to provide new insights into lipidome dynamics in health and disease.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"1840":{"study_id":"ST002082","study_title":"Predicting dying: a study of the metabolic changes and the dying process in patients with lung cancer","study_type":"Observational study","institute":"University of Liverpool Institute of Life Course & Medical Sciences","department":"","last_name":"Norman","first_name":"Brendan","email":"bnorman@liverpool.ac.uk","phone":"(+44)151 794 9064","submit_date":"2022-01-24","study_summary":"Background: Accurately recognising that a person may be dying is central for improving their experience of care. Yet recognising dying is difficult and predicting dying frequently inaccurate. Methods: Serial urine samples from patients (n=112) with lung cancer were analysed using high resolution untargeted mass spectrometry. ANOVA and volcano plot analysis demonstrated metabolites that changed in the last weeks of life. Further analysis identified potential biological pathways affected. Cox lasso logistic regression was engaged to develop a multivariable model predicting the probability of survival within the last 30 days of life. Results: In total 124 metabolites changed. ANOVA analysis identified 93 metabolites and volcano plot analysis 85 metabolites. 53 metabolites changed using both approaches. Pathways altered in the last weeks included those associated with decreased oral intake, muscle loss, decreased RNA and protein synthesis, mitochondrial dysfunction, disrupted \u03b2-oxidation and one carbon metabolism. Epinephrine and cortisol increased in the last 2 weeks and week respectively. A model predicting time to death using 7 metabolites had excellent accuracy (AUC= 0.86 at day 30, 0.88 at day 20 and 0.85 at day 10) and enabled classification of patients at low, medium and high risk of dying on a Kaplan-Meier survival curve.

The metabolic characteristics of each metabolic subtype were screened out and the relationship between metabolic subtype and the long-term prognosis was further identified. The clinical stages of PDAC did not show the metabolic differences at the serum metabolomic level.

The characteristic metabolites of each PDAC subtype were identified, and the metabolite model was established to distinguish the PDAC patients in the different subtypes. Among the three metabolic subtypes, choline-like type displayed better long-term prognosis compared with the other two types of patients.

Approaches to integrate such measures are still needed to increase understanding between systems-level exposure and biology. Objectives We address this gap by evaluating placental tissues to identify novel chemical-biological interactions associated with preeclampsia. This study tests the hypothesis that understudied chemicals are present in the human placenta and associated with preeclampsia-relevant disruptions, including overall case status (preeclamptic vs. normotensive patients) and underlying transcriptomic\/epigenomic signatures. Methods A non-targeted analysis based on high-resolution mass spectrometry was used to analyze placental tissues from a cohort of 35 patients with preeclampsia (n = 18) and normotensive (n = 17) pregnancies. Molecular feature data were queried against chemicals within the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s DSSTox database, and prioritized for confirmation based on association with preeclampsia case status and confidence of chemical identification. All molecular features were evaluated for relationships to mRNA, microRNA, and CpG methylation (i.e., multi-omic) signature alterations involved in preeclampsia. Results A total of 183 molecular features were identified with significantly differentiated abundance in placental extracts of preeclamptic patients; these features clustered into distinct chemical groupings using unsupervised methods. Of these features, 53 were identified (mapping to 40 distinct chemicals) using chemical standards, fragmentation spectra, and chemical metadata. In general, human metabolites had the largest feature intensities and strongest associations with preeclampsia-relevant multi-omic changes. Exogenous drugs were second most abundant and had fewer associations with multi-omic changes. Other exogenous chemicals (non-drugs) were least abundant and had the fewest associations with multi-omic changes. Conclusions These global data trends suggest that human metabolites are heavily intertwined with biological processes involved in preeclampsia etiology, while exogenous chemicals may still impact select transcriptomic\/epigenomic processes. This study serves as a demonstration of merging systems exposures with systems biology to better understand chemical-disease relationships.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"1909":{"study_id":"ST002152","study_title":"Metabolomics analysis of mouse liver with or without SIRT5 deficiency","study_type":"","institute":"North Carolina State University","department":"","last_name":"Liu","first_name":"Xiaojing","email":"xliu68@ncsu.edu","phone":"9195154387","submit_date":"2022-04-14","study_summary":"8 Wild-type (WT) and 8 Sirt5-\/- (SIRT5 KO) mice on 129 background were maintained on a standard chow diet (Teklad Global 18% Protein Rodent Diet, ENVIGO, Cat.#2018) until they were put on euthanized.

Objectives Endogenous metabolic profiles of control and graphene-treated keratinocytes have been studied using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography \u2013 mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS). Keratinocytes were treated with graphene oxide (GO) from two different suppliers and with few layer graphene (FLG). Samples were collected one week and one month after the start of the treatment.

Therefore, diagnostic methods with higher sensitivity at the early stage of the disease are needed to fill this gap. The aim of this study was to identify potential biomarkers of early schistosomiasis using an untargeted metabolomics approach. Serum of uninfected and S. mekongi-infected mice was collected at 2, 4, and 8 weeks post-infection.

Multivariate analysis distinguished between metabolites from the different experimental conditions. Biomarker screening was performed using three methods: correlation coefficient analysis; feature important detection with a random forest algorithm; and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Three compounds were identified as potential biomarkers at the early stage of the disease: heptadecanoyl ethanolamide; picrotin; and theophylline. The levels of these three compounds changed significantly during early-stage infection, and therefore these molecules may be promising schistosomiasis markers.

Transmembrane Protein 41B (TMEM41B) and Vacuole Membrane Protein 1 (VMP1) are two recently identified ER-resident lipid scramblases that play a role in autophagosome formation and cellular lipid metabolism. Importantly, TMEM41B is also a newly validated host dependency factor required for productive infection of several medically important enveloped RNA viruses, such as flaviviruses and human coronaviruses. However, the exact underlying mechanism of TMEM414B in modulating viral infections remains an open question. Here, we uncovered that TMEM41B and VMP1 deficiencies severely impaired replication of flavivirus and human coronavirus via multiple parallel cellular mechanisms. In accordance with previous reports, we validated that both TMEM41B and VMP1 are indispensable for all four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV) and human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) to infect human cells, but not chikungunya virus, an alphavirus. Impaired dengue virus replication in TMEM41B and VMP1 deficient cells could induce a robust activation of innate immune RNA sensing as evidenced by hyperactivation of RIG-I and MDA5. However, this phenomenon was a consequence but not the root cause of the diminished viral replication. Notably, the impact of TMEM41B deficiency on DENV replication could be reversed by complementing the cells using exogenous unsaturated fatty acids, indicating a metabolic role for TMEM41B in flavivirus infection. Furthermore, we found that derailed cellular energy metabolism could be a contributing factor to block DENV infection as TMEM41B and VMP1 deficient cells harbored higher levels of compromised mitochondria that exhibited aberrant functions in facilitating beta-oxidation. Using lipidome and metabolome profiling of TMEM41B and VMP1 deficient cells, we further revealed that each of these genetic deficiencies result in distinctive cellular metabolic dysregulations, underlining their necessity for a balanced metabolic landscape, and strengthening the metabolic role of these ER membrane proteins in facilitating virus infection. Our results highlighted that TMEM41B and VMP1 are required for homeostasis of cellular metabolism, and this metabolic role contributes to their essentiality in facilitating DENV infection.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"1922":{"study_id":"ST002165","study_title":"Untargeted metabolomics profiling of mice urine after 5 Gy and 7.5 Gy total body radiation exposure at 24 hours - LCMS Study.","study_type":"Untargeted LCMS","institute":"Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences","department":"Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences","last_name":"Rana","first_name":"Poonam","email":"poonamrana27@gmail.com","phone":"+911123905319","submit_date":"2021-11-24","study_summary":"Untargeted metabolomics profiling of mice urine after 5 Gy and 7.5 Gy total body radiation exposure at 24 hours.

Importantly, genetic deletion of Nnmt leads to alleviation of these metabolic abnormalities, and buffers cancer-dependent weight loss and reduction of the voluntary wheel-running activity. Our data also demonstrate that MNAM is capable of affecting urea cycle metabolites in the liver. These results suggest that cancers up-regulate the hepatic NNMT pathway to rewire liver metabolism towards uracil biogenesis rather than nitrogen disposal via the urea cycle, thereby disrupting host homeostasis. Anionic polar metabolites (i.e., organic acids, sugar phosphates, nucleotides, etc.) were analyzed via IC\/HR\/MS\/MS. Cationic polar metabolites (i.e., amino acids, bases, nucleosides, NAM, SAM, MNAM, SAH, me2PY, me4PY, etc) were analyzed via PFPP-LC\/HR\/MS\/MS.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"1925":{"study_id":"ST002168","study_title":"Multi-omics analyses of 398 foxtail millet accessions reveal genomic regions associated with domestication, metabolite traits and anti-inflammatory effects","study_type":"","institute":"Shanxi Agricultural University","department":"College of Life Sciences","last_name":"Li","first_name":"Xukai","email":"xukai_li@sxau.edu.cn","phone":"+86 15340810703","submit_date":"2022-05-09","study_summary":"Foxtail millet, domesticated from the wild species green foxtail, provides a rich source of phytonutrients for humans.

We identified hundreds of common variants that influence numerous secondary metabolites, with significant heterogeneity in the natural variation of metabolites and their underlying genetic architectures between different sub-groups of foxtail millet. The combined results from variations in genome, transcriptome and metabolome illustrated how breeding has altered foxtail millet metabolite content. Selection for alleles of genes associated with yellow grains led to altered metabolite profiles, such as carotenoids and endogenous hormones. The importance of PSY1 (phytoene synthase 1) for millet color was validated using CRISPR-Cas9. The in vitro cell inflammation assay showed that 83 metabolites have anti-inflammatory effects. This multi-omics study illustrates how the breeding history of foxtail millet has impacted metabolites.

Herein, an untargeted metabolomics approach based on the UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap-HRMS system was utilized for the discrimination between authentic and commercial Sengcu rice, a local specialty cultivated by terraced farming in northern Vietnam. A total of 8398 positive and 5250 negative mode compounds were introduced to multivariate statistical analyses for the construction of classification models. The first two principal components explaining 52% of the total variance in both datasets exhibited distinguished clusters of authentic against commercial Sengcu rice. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis models were optimized to obtain the optimal number of retained components, the optimal number of variables retained in each component and the best prediction distance type for model evaluation. One component containing five positive (DMG, RSA, RCA, PAL and BOSe) and six negative mode variables (PXP, RXP, TDHP, ISS, MXP and RGB) was sufficient to discriminate between authentic and commercial Sengcu rice. The classification error rate was less than 1.13\uf0b410-4, as determined from repeated k-fold cross validation. These putative signature metabolites clearly separated authentic and commercial Sengcu rice in the hierarchical clustering models. In addition, the isolated metabolites also reflected the cultivation practices of terraced farming of authentic Sengcu rice. Overall, we have proposed an effective method for the identification of key metabolites from fingerprinting metabolomics, and it could serve as a fundamental approach for other in-depth food authentication studies.","subject_species":"Oryza sativa"},"1927":{"study_id":"ST002170","study_title":"Cecal metabolome of specific-pathogen-free mice fed with five distinct rodent diets with varying fiber content and source.","study_type":"","institute":"Luxembourg Institute of Health","department":"Department of Infection and Immunity","last_name":"Desai","first_name":"Mahesh S","email":"mahesh.desai@lih.lu","phone":"+352 26970-389","submit_date":"2022-05-18","study_summary":"In an effort to discern the effects of diverse fibers on host immunity, we employed five distinct rodent diets with varying fiber content and source in specific-pathogen-free.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"1928":{"study_id":"ST002171","study_title":"Serum metabolome of specific-pathogen-free mice fed with five distinct rodent diets with varying fiber content and source.","study_type":"","institute":"Luxembourg Institute of Health","department":"Department of Infection and Immunity","last_name":"Desai","first_name":"Mahesh S","email":"mahesh.desai@lih.lu","phone":"+352 26970-389","submit_date":"2022-05-19","study_summary":"In an effort to discern the effects of diverse fibers on host immunity, we employed five distinct rodent diets with varying fiber content and source in specific-pathogen-free.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"1929":{"study_id":"ST002172","study_title":"Cecal metabolome of gnotobiotic (containing a 14-member synthetic human gut microbiota), and germ-free mice fed with two distinct rodent diets with varying fiber content.","study_type":"","institute":"Luxembourg Institute of Health","department":"Department of Infection and Immunity","last_name":"Desai","first_name":"Mahesh S","email":"mahesh.desai@lih.lu","phone":"+352 26970-389","submit_date":"2022-05-19","study_summary":"In an effort to discern the effects of diverse fibers on host immunity, we employed five distinct rodent diets with varying fiber content in gnotobiotic (containing a 14-member synthetic human gut microbiota), and germ-free mice.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"1930":{"study_id":"ST002173","study_title":"Unveiling the mechanism of action of nature-inspired anti-cancer compounds using a multi-Omics approach","study_type":"","institute":"University of Sharjah","department":"Sharjah Institute for Medical Research","last_name":"Giddey","first_name":"Alexander","email":"agiddey@sharjah.ac.ae","phone":"+971 6 5057417","submit_date":"2022-04-06","study_summary":"Novel anti-cancer compounds SIMR-3058 and SIMR-3066 were tested against MCF-7. The 2020 global cancer registry has ranked breast cancer (BCa) as the most commonly diagnosed type of cancer and the most common cause of cancer-related deaths, especially in women worldwide. Increased resistance and significant side effects continue to limit the efficacy of anti-BCa drugs, hence the need to identify new drug targets and to develop novel compounds to overcome these limitations. Nature-inspired anti-cancer compounds are becoming increasingly popular since they often provide a relatively safe and effective alternative. In this study, we employed multi-omics techniques to gain insights into the novel and potentially relevant mechanism of action of two recently identified nature- inspired anti-cancer compounds (SIMR 3066 and SIMR 3058). Discovery proteomics analysis combined with LC-MS\/MS-based untargeted metabolomics analysis was performed on compound-treated vs. DMSO-treated control MCF-7 cells. Downstream protein functional analysis showed that most of the responsive proteins were functionally associated with antigen processing and neutrophil degranulation, RNA catabolism and protein folding as well as cytoplasmic vesicle lumen and mitochondrial matrix formation. Consistent with the proteomics findings, metabolomic pathway analysis suggested that SIMR compounds could alter metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, metabolomics-based enriched-for-action pathway analysis showed that the of two SIMR compounds associate with mercaptopurine and thioguanine and azathiprine. Lastly, joint proteomics and metabolomics analysis revealed that treatment of BCa with SIMR3066 disrupts several signaling pathways including such p53-mediated apoptosis and the circadian entertainment pathway. Overall, the multi-omics we used in this study seems potent at probing the mechanism of action of novel anti-cancer agents.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"1931":{"study_id":"ST002174","study_title":"Identifying a tryptophan derivative in hydrogen peroxide-treated cell culture medium","study_type":"","institute":"NYU Langone Health","department":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology","last_name":"Choi","first_name":"Byeong Hyeok","email":"ByeongHyeok.Choi@nyulangone.org","phone":"2122635521","submit_date":"2022-04-06","study_summary":"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are by-products of metabolism of oxygen and they play an important role in normal homeostasis and cell signaling, as well as in the initiation of diseases including cancer when their production is upregulated.

This study harnesses multiomics analyses to characterize TM\u03c6s and unveils their unique metabolic features. We find that the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is preferentially activated in TM\u03c6s, responding to the reduction-oxidation demands associated with the efferocytosis of dying thymocytes. The blockade of PPP in M\u03c6s leads to decreased efferocytosis, which can be rescued by ROS scavengers.

In this report, we compared the potential therapeutic effects of pharmacological Beclin-1 activating peptide, TB-peptide, on the cardiac outcomes of young adult and aged mice during endotoxemia. We further examined alterations in myocardial metabolism induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge with and without the TB-peptide treatment. Methods and Results: C57BL\/6J mice of 10-week and 24-month-old were challenged by LPS at doses at which cardiac dysfunction occurred. Following the treatment of TB-peptide or control vehicle, heart contractility, circulating cytokines, and myocardial autophagy were evaluated. A targeted metabolomics assay was applied to analyze cardiac metabolism. TB-peptide boosted autophagic response, attenuated cytokine production, and improved cardiac performance in both young and aged mice during endotoxemia. A targeted metabolomics assay was designed to detect a pool of 361 known metabolites, of which 156 were detected in at least one of the heart tissue samples. LPS-induced impairments were found in glucose and amino acid (AA) metabolisms in mice of all ages, and TB-peptide provided ameliorative effects to rescue these alterations. However, lipid metabolites were upregulated in the young group but moderately downregulated in the aged by LPS, suggesting an age-dependent response. TB-peptide mitigated LPS-mediated trend of lipids in the young mice but provided little effect on the aged ones. Conclusion: Pharmacological activation of Beclin-1 by TB-peptide protects the heart in both young and aged population during endotoxemia, suggest a therapeutic potential for sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy. Metabolomics analysis suggests that this age-independent protection by TB-peptide is associated with reprograming of energy production via glucose and AA metabolisms.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"1936":{"study_id":"ST002179","study_title":"Impact of nitisinone on the cerebrospinal fluid metabolome of a murine model of alkaptonuria","study_type":"","institute":"University of Liverpool Institute of Life Course & Medical Sciences","department":"","last_name":"Davison","first_name":"Andrew","email":"andrew.davison@liverpoolft.nhs.uk","phone":"0151 706 4011","submit_date":"2022-05-13","study_summary":"Background: Nitisinone induced hypertyrosinaemia is well documented in Alkaptonuria (AKU), and there is uncertainty over whether it may contribute to a decline in cognitive function and or mood by altering neurotransmitter metabolism.

Methods: 17 CSF samples were collected from BALB\/c Hgd-\/-mice (n=8, treated with nitisinone \u2013 4 mg\/L and n=9, no treatment). Samples were diluted 1:1 with deionised water and analysed using a 1290 Infinity II liquid chromatography system coupled to a 6550 quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Agilent, Cheadle, UK). Raw data were processed using a targeted feature extraction algorithm and an established in-house accurate mass retention time database.

Animal models show that signs of liver injury and perturbed lipid metabolism asso-ciated with NAFLD begin in utero; however, safe dietary therapeutics to blunt developmental programming of NAFLD are unavailable. Using a mouse model of maternal Western-style diet (WD), we previously showed that pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), a potent dietary antioxidant, protected offspring of WD-fed dams from development of NAFLD and NASH. Here, we used untargeted mass spectrometry-based lipidomics to delineate lipotoxic effects of WD on offspring liver and identify lipid targets of PQQ. PQQ exposure during pregnancy altered hepatic lipid profiles of WD-exposed offspring, upregulating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) \u03b1 signaling and mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation to markedly attenuate triglyceride accumulation beginning in utero. Surprisingly, the abundance of very long-chain ceramides, important in promoting gut barrier and hepatic function, was significantly elevated in PQQ-treated offspring. PQQ exposure reduced the hepatic phosphatidylcho-line\/phosphatidylethanolamine (PC\/PE) ratio in WD-fed offspring and improved glucose toler-ance. Notably, levels of protective n \u2212 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) were elevated in offspring exposed to PQQ, beginning in utero, and the increase in n \u2212 3 PUFAs persisted into adulthood.

To determine the contribution and interplay of these two regulators in modulating central metabolism, virulence, and biofilm development we constructed and characterized codY ccpA double mutant in S. aureus UAMS-1. In line with previous studies, we found that CcpA and CodY control cellular metabolic status by altering carbon flow through the central and overflow metabolic pathways. Our results demonstrate that ccpA inactivation impairs biofilm formation and decreases incorporation of eDNA into the biofilm matrix while disrupting codY resulted in a robust structured biofilm tethered together with eDNA and PIA. Interestingly, inactivation of both codY and ccpA decreases biofilm biomass and neglects eDNA release in the double mutant. Compared to inactivation of codY, the codY ccpA mutant did not overexpress toxins but maintained overexpression of amino acid metabolism pathways. Furthermore, codY ccpA mutant produced higher amounts of PIA, in contrast to the wild-type strain and ccpA mutant. Overall, results of this study suggest that interplay between CodY and CcpA modulates central metabolism to optimize growth on preferred carbon sources while repressing virulence gene expression until nutrient limitation requires scavenging nutrients from the host.","subject_species":"Staphylococcus aureus"},"1944":{"study_id":"ST002188","study_title":"Metabolomic profiling reveals muscle metabolic changes following iliac arteriovenous fistula creation in mice (Lipid)","study_type":"Study of the skeletal muscle metabolome in mice with iliac arteriovenous fistula via 1H NMR","institute":"University of Florida","department":"Applied Physiology and Kinesiology","last_name":"Ryan","first_name":"Terence","email":"ryant@ufl.edu","phone":"352-294-1700","submit_date":"2022-02-17","study_summary":"In the present study, we hypothesize that the creation of an iliac AVF would result in significant alterations to the limb muscle metabolome.

Desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) is a mass spectrometry (MS) technique which has been widely used to study the main classes of lipid molecules on different tissue surfaces. This has been used to map lipid species and their distribution in Caco2 and HT29-MTX co-culture system. Methods and results: Caco2 and HT29-MTX cells were seeded on coverslips either singly or as cocultures in ratios of 75:25 and 50:50. Cells were cultured for 21 days before MS imaging using a DESI source in both the positive and negative ionization modes. The identity of selected lipids was confirmed in negative and positive ionisation modes using tandem MS. Although many lipids were common to both cell lines, there were distinctive patterns in the lipidomes. Thus, the lipidome of Caco2 cells was more heterogeneous and rich in cholesterol esters and triglycerides whilst HT29-MTX cells has a distinctive lipidome relating to phosphatidylethanolamines, phosphatidylinositols and odd chain lipids, including C17 fatty acids. Conclusion: DESI-MSI has shown that Caco2 and HT29-MTX cells have distinctive lipidomes which are still evident when the cells are cocultured. It has potential to both allow further validation of these widely used cell models and provide insights into how dietary components may modify lipid metabolism in future.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"1947":{"study_id":"ST002191","study_title":"Amelioration of developmental programming of NAFLD in fetal liver using PQQ","study_type":"Diet and PQQ treatment","institute":"University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center","department":"Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Harold Hamm Diabetes Center","last_name":"Jonscher","first_name":"Karen","email":"karen-jonscher@ouhsc.edu","phone":"3032294620","submit_date":"2022-04-20","study_summary":"Maternal obesity and consumption of a high-fat diet significantly elevate risk for pediatric non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), affecting 10% of children in the US.

At 10 weeks of age, serum IgE and IgG1 levels are increased, and Th2 cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, produced by CD4+ cells are upregulated, followed by elevated serum histamine levels at 12 weeks of age. Skin lesions manifest as epidermal hyperplasia at 8 weeks of age, while there are few morphological changes at 4 weeks of age.

The improvement in our understanding of the mechanisms of how trees precisely can predict environmental threats and cope with these stresses benefits our natural selection or genetic improvement to the maintenance of forest sustainability. In this work, we investigate the metabolic changes in heat and drought combined stress in Pinus pinaster plantlets. Maritime pine is a coniferous tree with native populations distributed across the European Atlantic and Mediterranean basins and the north of Africa ranging from cool moist to warm dry climates. This species shows high plasticity and a contrasting adaptive capacity and resilience. This plasticity in the response to stress exposure may be associated with a differential ability to modulate their secondary metabolism. For this reason, the current study aims to investigate the gradual and synergetic metabolomic response using liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based on untargeted metabolomic profiling of four stress levels. These metabolic profiles were supported by physiological and biochemical determinations. Our results showed that the metabolic profiles induced by low-stress exposition represent an adaptive conditioning mode with metabolome changes that help seedlings to cope with upcoming stress. The metabolism pathways involved in this response were mainly included in amino acid metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism leading to an enhanced accumulation of phenolics, flavonoids, and terpenoids. However, when the plantlets were exposed to higher-stress exposition, the secondary metabolites that starred the response are more complex and decorated, such as alkaloids, lignans, and glycosyloxyflavones. Those changes could help to maintain homeostasis and control the response magnitude on establishing and facilitating the plantlets\u2019 survival. Overall, our findings provide new insights into the responsive mechanisms of the maritime pine under heat and drought stress in terms of metabolic profiles.","subject_species":"Pinus pinaster"},"1955":{"study_id":"ST002199","study_title":"FOXA2 controls the anti-oxidant response in FH-deficient cells independent of NRF2","study_type":"","institute":"CECAD Research Center","department":"","last_name":"Yang","first_name":"Ming","email":"ming.yang@uni-koeln.de","phone":"4922147884306","submit_date":"2022-06-01","study_summary":"Hereditary Leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer is caused by fumarate hydratase loss of heterozygosity and subsequence accumulation of fumarate.

Microglia are the predominant source of CD39, while CD73 is principally expressed by tumor cells, particularly in tumors with amplification of EGFR and astrocyte-like differentiation. Spatially-resolved single-cell analyses demonstrate strong spatial correlation between tumor CD73 and microglial CD39, and that their spatial proximity is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Together, this data reveals that tumor CD73 expression correlates with tumor genotype, lineage differentiation, and functional states, and that core purine regulatory enzymes expressed by neoplastic and tumor-associated myeloid cells interact to promote a distinctive adenosine-rich signaling niche and immunosuppressive microenvironment potentially amenable to therapeutic targeting.

E-Sirt1-KO mice have higher energy expenditure and are partially protected from high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance. Enhanced insulin sensitivity and peripheral tissue Akt phosphorylation in E-Sirt1-KO mice is transferrable to wild-type mice via the systemic circulation after surgical parabiosis.

Fumarate hydratase (FH), a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyses the reversible hydration of fumarate to malate in the TCA cycle, has been identified as a bona fide tumour suppressor . FH loss predisposes to Hereditary Leiomyomatosis and Renal Cell Carcinoma (HLRCC), a cancer syndrome characterized by the presence of benign tumours of the skin and uterus, and a highly aggressive form of renal cancer. Its loss leads to aberrant accumulation of fumarate, an oncometabolite that drives malignant transformation . Even though the link between FH loss, fumarate accumulation and HLRCC is well-known, the associated tumorigenic mechanism is it is still not fully understood. Indeed, although HLRCC tumours metastasize even when small, Fh1-deficient mice develop premalignant cysts in the kidneys, rather than overt carcinomas. Interestingly, these cysts are positive for the key tumour suppressor p21. Since p21 expression is a central trigger of cellular senescence, it is postulated that this process could be an obstacle for tumorigenesis in Fh1-deficient cells. Consistent with this hypothesis, HLRCC patients harbour the epigenetic suppression of p16, another key player of senescence. Here, we have confirmed that additional oncogenic events independent from a senescence bypass are required to allow full-blown transformation in FH deficient cells. Moreover, a genome wide CRISPR\/Cas9 screen identified HIRA as a target that, when ablated, increases proliferation and invasion in Fh1-deficient cells. Moreover, Fh1 and Hira-deficient cells lead to the development of tumours and invasive features in the kidney in vivo. Strikingly, Hira depletion in Fh1 deficient cells controls the activation of a MYC and E2F-dependent transcriptional and metabolic program, which is known to play different oncogenic roles during tumour initiation and progression. Of note, the activation of these programs is independent of H3.3 deposition into the chromatin, known to be controlled by HIRA. Overall, we have identified a novel oncogenic event occurring in FH deficient tumours, which will be instrumental for understanding mechanisms of tumorigenesis in HLRCC and the development of targeted treatments.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"1961":{"study_id":"ST002206","study_title":"Lipolysis-derived Lipids Determine Autophagy Initiation during Fasting","study_type":"","institute":"Seoul National University","department":"","last_name":"Ji","first_name":"Yul","email":"withyul@snu.ac.kr","phone":"01025076912","submit_date":"2022-04-27","study_summary":"For survival, autophagy is a crucial intracellular self-degradation process to provide energy sources, helping adapt to nutrient deprivation.

Here, we showed that PKA-dependent lipolysis can block the initiation of futile autophagy during short-term nutritional deprivation by repressing AMPK. Using Raman microscopy imaging and metabolomics, we found that autophagy occurred by reduction in available free fatty acids (FFAs) for energy sources. By modulating genes involved in lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation, we found that the use of lipolysis-derived FFAs precedes autophagy initiation. The dysregulated autophagy suppression during short-term fasting decreased motility and lifespan extension of worms. Taken together, these data suggest that PKA is a pivotal factor to orchestrate sophisticated catabolic pathways, preferring the use of PKA-mediated lipolytic products to repress futile autophagic degradation during short-term fasting through AMPK inhibition.","subject_species":"Caenorhabditis elegans"},"1962":{"study_id":"ST002207","study_title":"Metabolomic analysis to assess response to immunotherapy for malignant brain tumors: Part 1","study_type":"Cancer surrogate biomarker discovery","institute":"University of Florida","department":"Neurosurgery","last_name":"Khattri","first_name":"Ram","email":"rbk11@ufl.edu","phone":"330-785-6045","submit_date":"2022-06-09","study_summary":"An effective immune response in patients with cancer treated with immunotherapy includes dendritic cell (DC) activation and migration followed by stimulation of CD8 and CD4 T cells.

Fumarate hydratase (FH), a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyses the reversible hydration of fumarate to malate in the TCA cycle, has been identified as a bona fide tumour suppressor . FH loss predisposes to Hereditary Leiomyomatosis and Renal Cell Carcinoma (HLRCC), a cancer syndrome characterized by the presence of benign tumours of the skin and uterus, and a highly aggressive form of renal cancer. Its loss leads to aberrant accumulation of fumarate, an oncometabolite that drives malignant transformation . Even though the link between FH loss, fumarate accumulation and HLRCC is well-known, the associated tumorigenic mechanism is it is still not fully understood. Indeed, although HLRCC tumours metastasize even when small, Fh1-deficient mice develop premalignant cysts in the kidneys, rather than overt carcinomas. Interestingly, these cysts are positive for the key tumour suppressor p21. Since p21 expression is a central trigger of cellular senescence, it is postulated that this process could be an obstacle for tumorigenesis in Fh1-deficient cells. Consistent with this hypothesis, HLRCC patients harbour the epigenetic suppression of p16, another key player of senescence. Here, we have confirmed that additional oncogenic events independent from a senescence bypass are required to allow full-blown transformation in FH deficient cells. Moreover, a genome wide CRISPR\/Cas9 screen identified HIRA as a target that, when ablated, increases proliferation and invasion in Fh1-deficient cells. Moreover, Fh1 and Hira-deficient cells lead to the development of tumours and invasive features in the kidney in vivo. Strikingly, Hira depletion in Fh1 deficient cells controls the activation of a MYC and E2F-dependent transcriptional and metabolic program, which is known to play different oncogenic roles during tumour initiation and progression. Of note, the activation of these programs is independent of H3.3 deposition into the chromatin, known to be controlled by HIRA. Overall, we have identified a novel oncogenic event occurring in FH deficient tumours, which will be instrumental for understanding mechanisms of tumorigenesis in HLRCC and the development of targeted treatments.

The liver plays an essential role in maintaining whole-body metabolic homeostasis and is structurally defined by metabolic zones. These zones are well-understood on the transcriptomic level, but have not been comprehensively characterized on the metabolomic level. Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) can be used to map hundreds of metabolites directly from a tissue section, offering an important advance to investigate metabolic heterogeneity in tissues compared to extraction-based metabolomics methods that analyze tissue metabolite profiles in bulk. We established a workflow for the preparation of tissue specimens for matrix-assisted laser desorption\/ionization (MALDI) MSI that can be implemented to achieve broad coverage of central carbon, nucleotide, and lipid metabolism pathways. Herein, we used this approach to visualize the effect of nutrient stress and excess on liver metabolism. Our data revealed a highly organized metabolic tissue compartmentalization in livers, which becomes disrupted under high fat diet. Fasting caused changes in the abundance of several metabolites, including increased levels of fatty acids and TCA intermediates while fatty livers had higher levels of purine and pentose phosphate-related metabolites, which generate reducing equivalents to counteract oxidative stress. This spatially conserved approach allowed the visualization of liver metabolic compartmentalization at 30 \u00b5m pixel resolution and can be applied more broadly to yield new insights into metabolic heterogeneity in vivo.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"1974":{"study_id":"ST002220","study_title":"Catabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) in renal cells HK2 and 786-O","study_type":"","institute":"CECAD Research Center","department":"","last_name":"Yang","first_name":"Ming","email":"ming.yang@uni-koeln.de","phone":"+4922147884306","submit_date":"2022-07-15","study_summary":"The objective of this experiment is to compare the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) in human renal epithelial cell line HK2 versus ccRCC cell lines 786-O, 786-M1A and 786-M2A using 13C6-labelled leucine and isoleucine stable isotope tracers.

Here we tested the effects of pharmacological and genetic manipulation of ACSS2 on HIF-2\u03b1, ccRCC cells, and tumors. ACSS2 inhibition led to HIF-2\u03b1 degradation and suppressed ccRCC growth in vitro, in vivo, and in primary cell cultures of ccRCC patient tumors.

Here, we study the impact of normoxia on the mito-nuclear communication with regards to stem cell differentiation. We show that normoxia-cultured MSCs undergo profound transcriptional alterations which cause irreversible osteogenesis defects. Mechanistically, high oxygen promotes chromatin compaction and histone hypo-acetylation, particularly on promoters and enhancers of osteogenic genes. Although normoxia induces metabolic rewiring resulting in high acetyl-CoA levels, histone hypo-acetylation occurs due to trapping of acetyl-CoA inside mitochondria, owing to lower CiC activity. Strikingly, restoring the cytosolic acetyl-CoA pool remodels the chromatin landscape and rescues the osteogenic defects. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the metabolism-chromatin-osteogenesis axis is heavily perturbed in response to high oxygen and identify CiC as a novel, oxygen-sensitive regulator of the MSC function.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"1997":{"study_id":"ST002243","study_title":"Lipidomics analysis of Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) (part II)","study_type":"Untargeted and targeted (PRM) analysis","institute":"University of Pennsylvania","department":"","last_name":"Wang","first_name":"Dezhen","email":"dezhen.wang@pennmedicine.upenn.edu","phone":"5312185610","submit_date":"2022-07-29","study_summary":"Friedreich\u2019s Ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal neurodegenerative disease caused by the deficiency of protein frataxin.

Because of the usage of nanoparticles (NPs) as carriers for chemotherapeutic agents, the therapeutic efficacy of these treatments has been significantly boosted. This was accomplished by increasing the bioavailability of the pharmaceuticals and changing the bio-distribution profile of the drugs. Untargeted metabolomics has recently risen to the forefront as a potentially useful method for better comprehending the growth of tumours and the treatment outcomes of many kinds of cancer cells. In the current study, we used LCMS\/MS-based untargeted metabolomics to identify differences in the metabolic profile of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas FaDu that were treated with the anticancer drug paclitaxel (PTX) delivered as free drug versus paclitaxel-loaded poly(lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles (PXT-PLGA-NPs). The experimental design consisted of four groups: those treated with DMSO (serving as a control), those treated with drug-free PXT, those treated with PXT-PLGA-NPs, and those treated with PLGA-NPs that lacked PTX. MetaboScape (V4, Bruker Daltonics) was used as the platform for the data analysis, and the results were compared to the Bruker Human Metabolome Data Base (HMDB) spectrum library 2.0. We found a total of 162 metabolites with a high level of confidence ascribed to them. The principal component analysis of the metabolites showed that PTX-free drugs grouped along with PXT-PLGA-NPs, but the control and PLGA-NPs without PXT clustered apart from drug-treated cells but together with each other. In further group pairwise comparisons, it was shown that 37 metabolites were substantially dysregulated (p 0.05) between the PTX-free medication and the PXT-PLGA-NPs. Out of these, it is important to call attention to the metabolites that became more abundant as a result of treatment with PXT-PLGA-NPs. These include 5-Thymidyclic acid with a 7.8-fold change (FC) and 3,4,5-Trimethoxycinnamic acid, both of which have been linked in the past to effective anticancer drug treatment (Quinn et al. 2015; Anantharaju et al. 2017).

Dietary, anthropometric, biochemical, and physical activity assessments were performed before and at the end of the fasting month. The metabolomic assay was performed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry for the two-time points. Metabolomics assay revealed a significant reduction in a few metabolites. The analysis revealed that 27 metabolites differed significantly (P&lt;0.05) between pre-and post-RDIF. Among the differentially abundant metabolites, 23 showed a decrease with fasting, these included several amino acids such as aspartame, tryptophan, phenylalanine, histidine, and other metabolites including valeric acid, and cortisol.

Objective: We sought to quantify small molecules in the plasma of children with exacerbation- prone asthma through mass spectrometry-based metabolomics. We hypothesized that the plasma metabolome of these children would differ from that of children with non-exacerbation- prone asthma. Methods: Plasma metabolites were extracted from four pediatric asthma cohorts (n=215 total, n=41 with exacerbation-prone asthma) and detected using a ZIC-HILIC column coupled to a Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer. High-confidence annotations were retained for univariate analysis and were confirmed by a sensitivity analysis in subjects on high-dose inhaled corticosteroids. Metabolites that varied by cohort were excluded. Metaboanalyst was used to identify pathways of interest. Concentrations were calculated by reference standardization to NIST SRM 1950. Results: We identified 32 unique, cohort-independent metabolites that differed in children with exacerbation-prone asthma compared to children with non-exacerbation-prone asthma. Comparison of metabolite concentrations to literature-reported values for healthy children revealed that most metabolites were decreased in both asthma groups, but more so in exacerbation-prone asthma. Pathway analysis identified arginine, lysine, and methionine pathways as most impacted. Conclusions: Several plasma metabolites are perturbed in children with exacerbation-prone asthma and are largely related to arginine, lysine, and methionine pathways. While validation is needed, plasma metabolites may be potential biomarkers for exacerbation-prone asthma in children.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"2006":{"study_id":"ST002252","study_title":"Lipidomics analysis on Arabidopsis autophagy mutants","study_type":"","institute":"Iowa State University","department":"Biochemistry Biophysics, and Molecular Biology","last_name":"Ding","first_name":"Geng","email":"gengding@iastate.edu","phone":"515-294-0347","submit_date":"2022-02-21","study_summary":"Autophagy is an essential cellular process in eukaryotes that degrades and recycles macromolecules and organelles.

The standard method for diagnosis of Trichinella infection is immunological techniques, which lack of sensitivity and timeliness. Metabolomics has been extensively used to identify compounds with diagnostic potential in many diseases, however, there is no study regarding biomarker discovery in trichinellosis yet. Therefore, this study aims to identify potential biomarkers of trichinellosis using metabolomics.

Therefore, we pioneeringly proposed Spatial Temporal Operative Real Metabolomics (STORM) strategy that established a relationship between metabolic phenotypes and functions to accurately character abnormal metabolisms and further identify operative functional molecules as novel therapeutic targets.

And the quantitative consequences of related enzymes annotated the unique molecular mechanisms of purine metabolism regulations by gemcitabine.

IF proliferation re-establishes a constant liver-to-body-mass ratio during periods of fasting and re-feeding, a process termed the hepatostat. This study provides the first example of dietary influence on adult hepatocyte proliferation, and challenges the widely held view that liver tissue is mostly quiescent unless chemically or mechanically injured.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"2014":{"study_id":"ST002265","study_title":"Multi-omic analysis reveals bacteria may have a role in dental erosion","study_type":"Research Study","institute":"King's College London","department":"","last_name":"Cleaver","first_name":"Leanne","email":"leanne.cleaver@kcl.ac.uk","phone":"07464626438","submit_date":"2022-08-02","study_summary":"NMR was performed on 11 saliva samples; 5 from participants classified as having dental erosion and 6 from healthy control participants with no dental erosion to assess the differences in metabolome between the two groups.

Pathological reduction of ATs in lipodystrophy leads to an array of metabolic diseases. Understanding the underlying mechanisms may benefit the development of effective therapies. Several cellular processes, including autophagy, function collectively to maintain AT homeostasis. Here, we investigated the impact of adipocyte-specific deletion of the autophagy-related lipid kinase PIK3C3 on AT homeostasis and systemic metabolism in mice. We report that PIK3C3 functions in all ATs and that its absence disturbs adipocyte autophagy and hinders adipocyte differentiation, survival, and function with differential effects on brown and white ATs. These abnormalities caused loss of white ATs, whitening followed by loss of brown ATs, and impaired browning of white ATs. Consequently, mice exhibited compromised thermogenic capacity and developed dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. While these effects of PIK3C3 contrast previous findings with the autophagy-related protein ATG7 in adipocytes, mice with a combined deficiency in both factors revealed a dominant role of the PIK3C3-deficient phenotype. We also found that dietary lipid excess exacerbates AT pathologies caused by PIK3C3 deficiency. Surprisingly, glucose tolerance was spared in adipocyte-specific PIK3C3-deficient mice, a phenotype that was more evident during dietary lipid excess. These findings reveal a crucial yet complex role for PIK3C3 in ATs and suggest the potential of targeting this factor for therapeutic intervention in metabolic diseases.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"2018":{"study_id":"ST002269","study_title":"Targeted plasma metabolomics in pediatric NAFLD patients","study_type":"","institute":"Seoul National University College of Medicine and Hospital","department":"Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics","last_name":"Chae","first_name":"Woori","email":"yunus@snu.ac.kr","phone":"82-2-740-8905","submit_date":"2022-08-07","study_summary":"Several adult omics studies have been conducted to understand the pathophysiology of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

Usually, HCC is diagnosed in advanced stages, where sorafenib, a multiple target ty-rosine kinase inhibitor, is used as the first line of treatment. Unfortunately, resistance to sorafenib is usually encountered within six months of the treatment. Therefore, there is a critical need to identify the underlying reasons for drug resistance. In the present study, we investigated the proteomic and metabolomics alterations accompanying to sorafenib resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma Hep3B cells by employing ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS). The Bruker Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) library was used to identify the differentially abundant metabolites through MetaboScape 4.0 software (Bruker). For protein annotation and identification, the Uniprot proteome for Homo sapiens (Human) da-tabase was utilised through MaxQuant. The results revealed that 27 metabolites and 18 proteins were significantly dysregulated due to sorafenib resistance in Hep3B cells compared to the parental phenotype. D-alanine, L-proline, o-tyrosine, succinic acid and phosphatidylcholine (PC, 16:0\/16:0) were among the significantly altered metabolites. Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase isozyme L1, mitochondrial superoxide dismutase, UDP-glucose-6-dehydrogenase, sorbitol dehydrogenase and calpain small subunit 1 were among the significantly altered proteins. The findings revealed that resistant Hep3B cells demonstrated significant alterations in amino acid and nucleotide met-abolic pathways, energy production pathways and other pathways related to cancer aggressive-ness, migration, proliferation, and drug-resistance. Joint pathway enrichment analysis unveiled unique pathways, including the antifolate resistance pathway and other important pathways that maintain cancer cells' survival, growth, and proliferation.

However, SPT also uses alanine as a substrate in the contexts of low serine availability, alanine accumulation, or diseasecausing mutations in hereditary sensory neuropathy type I (HSAN1), resulting in the synthesis and accumulation of 1-deoxysphingolipids. These species promote cytotoxicity in neurons and impact diverse cellular phenotypes, including suppression of anchorage-independent cancer cell growth. While altered serine and alanine can promote 1-deoxysphingolipid synthesis, they impact numerous other metabolic pathways important for cancer cells. Here we combined isotope tracing, quantitative metabolomics, and functional studies to better understand the mechanistic drivers of 1- deoxysphingolipid toxicity in cancer cells. Both alanine treatment and SPTLC1 C133W expression induce 1-deoxy(dihydro)ceramide synthesis and accumulation but fail to broadly impact intermediary metabolism, abundances of other lipids, or growth of adherent cells. However, spheroid culture and soft agar colony formation were compromised when endogenous 1-deoxysphingolipid synthesis was induced via SPTLC1 C133W expression. Consistent with these impacts on anchorageindependent cell growth, we observed that 1-deoxysphingolipid synthesis reduced plasma membrane endocytosis.

Despite its role as a commensal, SE has emerged as an opportunistic pathogen, associated with 80% of medical devices related infections. Moreover, these bacteria are extremely difficult to treat due to their ability to form biofilms and accumulate resistance to almost all classes of antimicrobials developed so far. Thus new preventive and therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. In spite of its clinical importance, the molecular mechanisms associated with SE colonisation and disease are still poorly understood. A deeper understanding of the metabolic and cellular processes associated with response to environmental factors characteristic of SE ecological niches in health and disease might provide new clues on colonisation and disease processes. Here we studied the impact of pH conditions, mimicking the skin pH (5.5) and blood pH (7.4), in a S. epidermidis commensal strain, belonging to the B clonal lineage, by means of next-generation proteomics and 1H NMR-based metabolomics. Moreover, we evaluated the metabolic changes occurring when a sudden pH change arise, simulating the skin barrier break produced by a catheter. We found that exposure of S. epidermidis to skin pH induced oxidative phosphorylation and biosynthesis of peptidoglycan, lipoteichoic acids and betaine. In contrast, at blood pH, the incorporation of monosaccharides and its oxidation by glycolysis and fermentation was promoted. Additionally, several proteins related to virulence and immune evasion, namely extracellular proteases and membrane iron transporters were more abundant at blood pH. In the situation of an abrupt skin-to-blood pH shift we observed the decrease in the osmolyte betaine and changes in the levels of several metabolites and proteins involved in redox cell homeostasis. Our results suggest that at the skin pH S. epidermidis cells are metabolically more active and adhesion is promoted, while at blood pH, metabolism is tuned down and cells have a more virulent profile. pH increase during commensal-to-pathogen conversion appears to be a critical environmental signal to the remodelling of the S. epidermidis metabolism towards a more pathogenic state. Targeting S. epidermidis proteins induced by a low alkaline pH and local acidification of medical devices microenvironment might be new strategies to treat and prevent S. epidermidis infections.","subject_species":"Staphylococcus epidermidis"},"2027":{"study_id":"ST002278","study_title":"Modulation of blood metabolites by dietary \u03b2\u2013glucan in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) - Serum lipid concentrations","study_type":"","institute":"Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research","department":"","last_name":"Haange","first_name":"Sven","email":"sven.haange@ufz.de","phone":"0049 341 2351099","submit_date":"2022-08-19","study_summary":"Measurement of changes in serum lipid levels using targeted mass spectrometry","subject_species":"Oncorhynchus mykiss"},"2028":{"study_id":"ST002279","study_title":"Modulation of blood metabolites by dietary \u03b2\u2013glucan in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) - Serum amino acids and biogenic amines concentrations","study_type":"","institute":"Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research","department":"","last_name":"Haange","first_name":"Sven","email":"sven.haange@ufz.de","phone":"0049 341 2351099","submit_date":"2022-08-19","study_summary":"Measurement of changes in serum amino acids and biogenic amines levels using targeted mass spectrometry","subject_species":"Oncorhynchus mykiss"},"2029":{"study_id":"ST002280","study_title":"Oxidative phosphorylation selectively orchestrates tissue macrophage homeostasis","study_type":"Observational study","institute":"Spanish National Center for Cardiovascular Research (CNIC)","department":"Novel mechanisms of atherosclerosis","last_name":"Mastrangelo","first_name":"Annalaura","email":"annalaura.mastrangelo@cnic.es","phone":"(+34) 914531200","submit_date":"2022-09-01","study_summary":"In vitro studies associated oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) with anti-inflammatory macrophages, while pro-inflammatory macrophages rely on glycolysis.

Tfam deletion resulted in reduction of alveolar macrophages (AMs) due to impaired lipid-handling capacity, leading to increased cholesterol content and cellular stress, causing cell cycle arrest in vivo. In obesity, Tfam depletion selectively ablated pro-inflammatory lipid-handling white adipose tissue macrophages (WAT-MFs), preventing insulin resistance and hepatosteatosis. Thus, OXPHOS, rather than glycolysis, distinguishes TMF populations and is critical for the maintenance of TMFs with a high lipid-handling activity, including pro-inflammatory WAT-MFs.

The resulting model showed that pre-placement bone metabolome, lipidome and proteome profiles were clearly distinguishable from post-placement profiles. Metabolites associated with the pre-placement samples, suggested an extinction of the energetic metabolism and a switch towards another source of fuelling (e.g., structural proteins). We were able to identify certain biomolecules from the three groups that show excellent potential for estimation of the PMI, predominantly the biomolecules from the metabolomics block. Our findings suggest that, by targeting a combination of compounds with different post-mortem stability, in future studies we could be able to estimate both short PMIs, by using metabolites and lipids, and longer PMIs, by including more stable proteins.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"2032":{"study_id":"ST002286","study_title":"PolyI:C Metabolome changes in liver, CSF, serum, and embryonic CSF and liver","study_type":"","institute":"Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School","department":"","last_name":"Petrova","first_name":"Boryana","email":"Boryana.Petrova@childrens.harvard.edu","phone":"6179197352","submit_date":"2022-09-25","study_summary":"Targeted MS analysis of maternal liver, CSF, serum, and embryonic CSF and liver, with saline and PolyI:C administrated to mother.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"2033":{"study_id":"ST002287","study_title":"Enhanced systemic commensal E. coli immunogenicity through minor alteration of the metabolic profile","study_type":"","institute":"University of Calgary","department":"Microbiology and Infectious Disease","last_name":"Brown","first_name":"Kirsty","email":"kirsty.brown1@ucalgary.ca","phone":"2508692232","submit_date":"2022-09-26","study_summary":"LC-MS data from the supernatant and cell pellet of cultured commensal E. coli with and without mutations in outer membrane porin C","subject_species":"Escherichia coli"},"2034":{"study_id":"ST002289","study_title":"Map of microbially induced metabolic changes across diverse body sites in mice - Bacterial culture data","study_type":"","institute":"University of Calgary","department":"Physiology and Pharmacology","last_name":"BROWN","first_name":"KIRSTY","email":"kirsty.brown1@ucalgary.ca","phone":"2508692232","submit_date":"2022-05-26","study_summary":"Metabolite profiles of culture supernatants from individual commensal bacteria isolated from the intestine of mice.","subject_species":"Several mouse commensals"},"2035":{"study_id":"ST002290","study_title":"Metabolic impact of anticancer drugs Pd2Spermine and Cisplatin on the polar metabolome of brain from cell-derived xenograft mouse model of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (part 1)","study_type":"NMR-based metabolomics","institute":"University of Aveiro","department":"Department of Chemistry and CICECO-Aveiro Institute of Materials","last_name":"Carneiro","first_name":"Tatiana Jo\u00e3o","email":"tatiana.joao@ua.pt","phone":"+351926369478","submit_date":"2022-09-14","study_summary":"Platinum (Pt(II)) drugs, e.g. cisplatin (cDDP), are some of the most used chemotherapeutic agents, yet tumor acquired resistance and high toxicity are still current drawbacks.

Moreover, factors that drive recovery from COVID-19 can be explored to identify correlates of protection. The cellular metabolism represents a potential target to improve survival upon severe disease, but the associations between the metabolism and the inflammatory response during COVID-19 are not well defined. We analyzed blood laboratorial parameters, cytokines, and metabolomes of 150 individuals with mild to severe disease, of which 33 progressed to a fatal outcome. A subset of 20 individuals was followed-up after hospital discharge and recovery of acute disease. We used hierarchical community networks to integrate metabolomics profiles with cytokines and markers of inflammation, coagulation, and tissue damage. Infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) promotes significant alterations in the plasma metabolome, whose activity varies according to disease severity and correlates with oxygen saturation. Differential metabolism underlying death was marked by amino acids and related metabolites, such as glutamate, tryptophan and oxoproline; and lipids, including progesterone, phosphocholine and lysophosphatidylcholines (lysoPCs). Individuals that recovered from severe disease displayed persistent alterations enriched for metabolism of purines, phosphatidylinositol phosphate and glycolysis. Recovery of mild disease was associated with vitamin E metabolism. Data integration shows that the metabolic response is a hub connecting other biological features during disease and recovery. Infection by SARS-CoV-2 induces concerted activity of metabolic and inflammatory responses that depend on disease severity and collectively predict clinical outcomes of COVID-19.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"2037":{"study_id":"ST002292","study_title":"Quantification of Dissolved Metabolites in Environmental Samples through Cation-Exchange Solid Phase Extraction (CX-SPE) paired with Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry","study_type":"Method Development for Dissolved Metabolomics in Seawater","institute":"University of Washington","department":"Oceanography","last_name":"Sacks","first_name":"Joshua","email":"jssacks@uw.edu","phone":"4074090052","submit_date":"2022-08-30","study_summary":"Small, biologically produced, organic molecules called metabolites play key roles in microbial systems where they directly mediate exchanges of nutrients, energy, and information.

Here we show that a cation-exchange solid phase extraction (CX-SPE) sample preparation approach separates positively charged and zwitterionic metabolites from seawater and freshwater samples, allowing their analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). We successfully extracted 69 known compounds from an in-house compound collection and evaluated the performance of the method by establishing extraction efficiencies and limits of detection (pM to low nM range) for these compounds. CX-SPE extracted a range of compounds including amino acids and compatible solutes, resulted in very low matrix effects, and performed robustly across large variations in salinity and dissolved organic matter (DOM) concentration. We compared CX-SPE to an established solid phase extraction procedure (PPL-SPE) and demonstrate that these two methods extract fundamentally different fractions of the dissolved metabolite pool with CX-SPE extracting compounds that are on average smaller and more polar. We use CX-SPE to analyze four environmental samples from distinct aquatic biomes, producing some of the first CX-SPE dissolved metabolomes.

Our study employed open field test, plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone determination, serum biochemical analysis, quantitative PCR, immunoblotting, enzyme activity assay, and NMR-based metabolomics to analyze and identify the biochemical variations of body fluids (serum and urine) and tissues (brain, kidney, liver, lung, and spleen) in an acute restraint stress-induced rat model of depression. Our data suggested that the post-stress effects on biochemical alterations involved different biochemical pathways, including regulating the NAD(P) pool, glucose homeostasis, biosynthesis and degradation of heme, and uric acid production and metabolism. The urinary excretion of nicotinate and nicotinamide N-oxide increased significantly. Thus, we conclude that the depletion of NAD(P) precursors may occur in response to restraint stress. Our results show a close association between NAD(P) deficiency and post-stress metabolic dysfunction, which would provide a ground for developing recovery-promoting micronutrients in treating depression.","subject_species":"Rattus norvegicus"},"2044":{"study_id":"ST002299","study_title":"Characterizing the intrauterine environment via untargeted metabolomics profiling of maternal blood collected during pregnancy (Healthy Start Cohort)-Part 1","study_type":"Prospective cohort study","institute":"University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus","department":"Epidemiology; Lifecourse Epidemiology of Adiposity and Diabetes (LEAD) Center","last_name":"Perng","first_name":"Wei","email":"Wei.Perng@CUAnschutz.edu","phone":"734-717-0982","submit_date":"2022-09-08","study_summary":"Healthy Start is a prospective, pre-birth cohort study that recruited pregnant participants from outpatient prenatal clinics at the University of Colorado Hospital between 2009 and 2014.

However, almost all such models, which relied on serum biomarkers, clinical data or a combination of both, were subsequently deemed as cumbersome, inadequate and\/or subject to bias. Moreover, although serum metabolomics profiling has shown significant differences among patients with different degrees of disease severity, the use of serum metabolomics profiling to identify prognostic biomarkers has, so far, been neglected. Herein, we sought to develop highly predictive models of disease severity by integrating routine laboratory findings and serum metabolomics profiling which identified several metabolites including K_4_aminophenol, acetaminophen and cytosine as potential biomarkers of disease severity in COVID-19 patients. Two models were subsequently developed and internally validated on the basis of ROC-AUC values. The predictive accuracy of the first model was 0.998 (95% CI: 0.992 to 1.000) with an optimal cut-off risk score of 4 biomarkers from among 8 linearly-related biomarkers (D-dimer, ferritin, neutrophil counts, Hp, sTfR, K_4_aminophenol, acetaminophen and cytosine). The predictive accuracy of the second model was 0.996 (95% CI: 0.989 to 1.000) with an optimal cut-off risk score of 3 biomarkers from among 6 biomarkers (D-dimer, ferritin, neutrophil counts, Hp, sTfR and cytosine). The two models are of high predictive power, need a small number of variables that can be acquired at minimal cost and effort, and can be applied independent of non-empirical clinical data. In conclusion, the metabolomics profiling data and the modeling work stemming from it, as presented here, could further explain the cause of COVID-19 disease prognosis and patient management.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"2047":{"study_id":"ST002302","study_title":"Integrated metabolomics and lipidomics study of patients with atopic dermatitis in response to dupilumab","study_type":"","institute":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences","department":"","last_name":"Zhang","first_name":"Lishan","email":"429647356@qq.com","phone":"+86-18612636397","submit_date":"2022-10-01","study_summary":"Background: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is one of the most common chronic inflammatory skin diseases. Dupilumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets the interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 receptors, has been widely used in AD because of its efficacy. However, metabolic changes occurring in patients with AD in response to dupilumab remains unknown. In this study, we integrated metabolomics and lipidomics analyses with clinical data to explore potential metabolic alterations associated with dupilumab therapeutic efficacy. In addition, we investigate whether the development of treatment side effects was linked to the dysregulation of metabolic pathways. Methods: A total of 33 patients with AD were included in the current study, with serum samples collected before and after treatment with dupilumab. Comprehensive metabolomic and lipidomic analyses have previously been developed to identify serum metabolites (including lipids) that vary among treatment groups. An orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis model was established to screen for differential metabolites and metabolites with variable importance in projection &gt; 1 and p &lt; 0.05 were considered potential metabolic biomarkers. MetaboAnalyst 5.0 was used to identify related metabolic pathways. Patients were further classified into two groups, well responders (n = 19) and poor responders (n = 14), to identify differential metabolites between the two groups. Results: The results revealed significant changes in serum metabolites before and after 16 weeks of dupilumab treatment. Variations in the metabolic profile were more significant in the well-responder group than in the poor-responder group. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that differential metabolites derived from the well-responder group were mainly involved in glycerophospholipid metabolism, valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis, the citrate cycle, arachidonic acid metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism, and sphingolipid metabolism. Conclusion: Serum metabolic profiles of patients with AD varied significantly after treatment with dupilumab. Differential metabolites and their related metabolic pathways may provide clues for understanding the effects of dupilumab on patient metabolism.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"2048":{"study_id":"ST002303","study_title":"Fitm2 is required for ER homeostasis and normal function of murine liver","study_type":"","institute":"Harvard School of Public Health","department":"","last_name":"Bond","first_name":"Laura","email":"laurabond44@gmail.com","phone":"8573087183","submit_date":"2022-09-17","study_summary":"The ER-resident protein fat-inducing transcript 2 (FIT2) catalyzes acyl-CoA cleavage in vitro and is required for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis and normal lipid storage in cells.

These mice also had more triglycerides in their livers than control littermates due, in part, to impaired secretion of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and reduced capacity for fatty acid oxidation. Challenging FIT2-LKO mice with a high-fat diet worsened hepatic ER stress and liver injury, but unexpectedly reversed the steatosis phenotype, similar to what is observed in FIT2-deficient cells loaded with fatty acids.

WNS-positive little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) can exhibit an immune response during infection that include increases in cytokine and pro-inflammatory mediator gene levels. While bioactive lipid mediators (oxylipins) formed by enzymatic oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) can contribute to this type of immune response, their role in WNS pathophysiology have not been investigated. Nonenzymatic conversion of PUFAs can also occur due to reactive oxygen species (ROS), however, these enantiomeric isomers will lack the same signaling properties. In this study, we performed a series of targeted lipidomic approaches on laboratory Pd-inoculated bats to assess changes in their splenic lipidome, including the formation of lipid mediators at early stages of WNS. Hepatic lipids previously identified were also resolved to a higher structural detail. We compared WNS-susceptible M. lucifugus to a WNS-resistant species, the big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus). Altered splenic lipid levels were only observed in M. lucifugus, with lower total levels of glycerophospholipids (GPs) and free fatty acids (FFAs) in the Pd-inoculated group compared to the sham-inoculated group. Lower concentrations of splenic GPs were observed in lipid compounds containing 18:2 or saturated acyl chains. Differences in splenic FFAs included both omega-3 (including docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) and omega-6 compounds. Increased levels of an enantiomeric monohydroxy DHA (4-hydroxydocosahexaenoic [HDoHE], 10-HDoHE, and 13-HDoHE) mixture, suggesting nonenzymatic formation, along with 6-keto-PGF1a were found. Changes in previously identified hepatic lipids were confined to omega-3 constituents. Together, these results suggest that increased oxidative stress, but not an inflammatory response, is occurring in bats at early stages of WNS that proceeds fat depletion.","subject_species":"Myotis lucifugus"},"2050":{"study_id":"ST002309","study_title":"Targeting malaria parasites with novel derivatives of azithromycin","study_type":"","institute":"Monash University","department":"","last_name":"Siddiqui","first_name":"Ghizal","email":"ghizal.siddiqui@monash.edu","phone":"99039282","submit_date":"2022-10-04","study_summary":"The spread of artemisinin resistant Plasmodium falciparum parasites is of global concern and highlights the need to identify new antimalarials for future treatments.

Here, 22 azithromycin analogues were explored for delayed death and quick-killing activities against P. falciparum (the most virulent human malaria) and P. knowlesi (a monkey parasite that frequently infects humans). Seventeen analogues showed improved quick-killing against both Plasmodium species, with up to 38 to 20-fold higher potency over azithromycin after less than 48 or 28 hours of treatment for P. falciparum and P. knowlesi, respectively. Lead analogues had limited activity against the related parasite Toxoplasma gondii and were &gt;5-fold more selective against malaria than human cells. Quick-killing analogues maintained activity throughout the blood stage lifecycle including ring stages of P. falciparum parasites (&lt;12 hrs treatment). Isopentenyl pyrophosphate supplemented parasites that lacked an apicoplast were equally sensitive to quick-killing analogues, confirming that the quick killing activity of these drugs was not directed at the apicoplast. Metabolomic profiling of parasites subjected to the lead analogue revealed a similar profile to chloroquine treatment, suggesting that the food-vacuole is a likely target of this drugs activity. The azithromycin analogues characterised in this study expanded the structural diversity over previously reported quick-killing compounds and provide new starting points to develop azithromycin analogues with quick-killing antimalarial activity.","subject_species":"Plasmodium falciparum"},"2051":{"study_id":"ST002310","study_title":"Cecal Microbiome in Phage treated broilers","study_type":"","institute":"La Agenzia nazionale per le nuove tecnologie, l'energia e lo sviluppo econ\u00f3mico sostenibile","department":"","last_name":"Lorenzo Rebenaque","first_name":"Laura","email":"laura.lorenzorebenaque@uchceu.com","phone":"615056012","submit_date":"2022-09-12","study_summary":"The objective of this study was to assess the impact of Salmonella bacteriophage treatment on microbiome in the ceca and serum of the broilers during the rearing period","subject_species":"Gallus gallus"},"2052":{"study_id":"ST002311","study_title":"Cecal Microbiota in Phage-treated Salmonella-infected broilers","study_type":"","institute":"Universidad Cardenal Herrera CEU","department":"","last_name":"Lorenzo-Rebenaque","first_name":"Laura","email":"laura.lorenzorebenaque@uchceu.es","phone":"615056012","submit_date":"2022-09-13","study_summary":"Analysis of the gastrointestinal microbiota of Salmonella-infected broilers has been carried out after the application of encapsulated bacteriophages in the feed, during the production cycle under farm conditions","subject_species":"Gallus gallus"},"2053":{"study_id":"ST002312","study_title":"Serum metabolome in Phage-treated Salmonella-infected broilers","study_type":"","institute":"Universidad Cardenal Herrera CEU","department":"","last_name":"Lorenzo-Rebenaque","first_name":"Laura","email":"laura.lorenzorebenaque@uchceu.es","phone":"615056012","submit_date":"2022-09-13","study_summary":"Analysis of the serum metabolome of Salmonella-infected broilers has been carried out after the application of encapsulated bacteriophages in the feed, during the production cycle under farm conditions","subject_species":"Gallus gallus"},"2054":{"study_id":"ST002313","study_title":"Dietary inclusion of nitrite-containing frankfurter exacerbates colorectal cancer pathology, increases oxidative stress, alters metabolism and causes gut dybiosis in APCmin mice","study_type":"","institute":"Institute for Global Food Security","department":"","last_name":"Pan","first_name":"Xiaobei","email":"x.pan@qub.ac.uk","phone":"02890975984","submit_date":"2022-09-20","study_summary":"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most prevelant malignancy in Europe and diet is an important modifiable risk factor.

The majority of detected metabolite features were ubiquitous across populations, despite any geographic, dietary, or behavioral differences. Such shared metabolite features included hyocholic acid and cholesterol. However, any characterization of the shared human fecal metabolome is insufficient without exploring the influence of industrialization. Here, we show chemical differences along an industrialization gradient, where the degree of industrialization correlates with metabolomic changes. We identified differential metabolite features like amino acid-conjugated bile acids and urobilin as major metabolic correlates of these behavioral shifts. Additionally, co-analyses with over 5,000 publicly available human fecal samples and co-occurrence probability analyses with the gut microbiome highlight connections between the human fecal metabolome and gut microbiome. Our results indicate that industrialization significantly influences the human fecal metabolome, but diverse human lifestyles and behavior still maintain a shared human fecal metabolome.

SETD1A degradation results in immediate downregulation of transcripts associated with DNA repair and heme biosynthesis pathways. CRISPR-based functional analyses and metabolomics reveal an essential role of SETD1A to maintain mitochondrial respiration in AML cells. These SETD1A targets are enriched in head-to-head (H2H) genes. SETD1A degradation disrupts a non-enzymatic SETD1A domain-dependent cyclin K function, increases the Ser5P RNA polymerase II (RNAP2) at TSS, and induces the promoter-proximal pausing of RNAP2 in a strand-specific manner.

How viruses alter the metabolic states of mucosal T cells and the precise mechanisms underlying the persisting immune dysfunction during chronic viral infections are key questions that have not been fully addressed. Here, by comparing transcriptome and salivary metabolome profiles of the uninfected individuals and people living with HIV (PLWH) on treatment, we found a role of polyamine metabolism in immune perturbations of the oral mucosa of HIV+ patients. Flow cytometry analysis confirmed the higher expression of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC-1) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (EIF5A), the polyamine metabolism intermediates in CD4+ T cells in PLWH. Mechanistic studies using an in vitro human tonsil organoid infection model revealed that HIV infection of activated T cells also resulted in increased polyamine synthesis, which was dependent on the activities of caspase-1, IL-1\u03b2, and ODC-1. HIV-1 also led to elevated dysfunctional regulatory T cells (TregDys) \/Thelper 17 (Th17) cell ratios as well as heightened expression of ODC-1, EIF5A, and hypusinated EIF5A. Blockade of caspase-1, ODC-1, and EIF5A hypusination and not HIF-1\u237a or NLRP3 reversed the frequency of TregDys showing the direct impact of polyamine pathway in Treg dysfunction during HIV-1 infection. The addition of exogenous polyamines increased TregDys percentages independent of HIV-1 infection in vitro. Finally, oral mucosal TregDys\/Th17 ratios and CD4 hyperactivation positively correlated with the increases in salivary putrescine levels, which were found to be elevated in the saliva of PLWH. Thus, by revealing the role of aberrantly increased polyamine synthesis during HIV infection, our study unveils a new mechanism by which chronic viral infections could drive distinct T cell effector programs and Treg dysfunction.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"2070":{"study_id":"ST002330","study_title":"Early-stage responses to Plasmodiophora brassicae at the metabolome levels in clubroot resistant and susceptible oilseed Brassica napus","study_type":"Timecourse experiment","institute":"Trent University","department":"Biology","last_name":"Kisiala","first_name":"Anna","email":"annakisiala@trentu.ca","phone":"7057481011","submit_date":"2022-10-17","study_summary":"A total of 36 samples comprised two types of genotypes [CR (5 individuals pooled in each biological replicate) and CS (5 individuals pooled in each biological replicate)], two treatments (inoculated and uninoculated) and three biological replicates generated from three independent experiments and collected at 1-, 4-, and 7\u2013DPI were used to extract primary and secondary metabolites and analyse the differences among the treatments.","subject_species":"Brassica napus"},"2071":{"study_id":"ST002331","study_title":"Comprehensive characterization of putative genetic influences on plasma metabolome in a pediatric cohort","study_type":"","institute":"Boston Childrens Hospital","department":"","last_name":"Kong","first_name":"Sek Won","email":"sekwon.kong@childrens.harvard.edu","phone":"6179192689","submit_date":"2022-10-13","study_summary":"Background: The human exposome is composed of diverse metabolites and small chemical compounds originated from endogenous and exogenous sources, respectively. Genetic and environmental factors influence metabolite levels while the extent of genetic contributions across metabolic pathways is not yet known. Untargeted profiling of human metabolome using high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) combined with genome-wide genotyping allows comprehensive identification of genetically influenced metabolites. As such previous studies of adults discovered and replicated genotype-metabotype associations. However, these associations have not been characterized in children. Results: We conducted the largest genome by metabolome-wide association study to date of children (N=441) using 619,688 common genetic variants and 14,342 features measured by HRMS. Narrow-sense heritability (h2) estimates of plasma metabolite concentrations using genomic relatedness matrix restricted maximum likelihood (GREML) method showed a bimodal distribution with high h2 (&gt;0.8) for 15.9% of features and low h2 (&lt;0.2) for most of features (62.0%). The features with high h2 were enriched for amino acid and nucleic acid metabolism while carbohydrate and lipid concentrations showed low h2. For each feature, a metabolite quantitative trait locus (mQTL) analysis was performed to identify genetic variants that were potentially associated with plasma levels. Fifty-four associations among 29 features and 43 genetic variants were identified at a genome-wide significance threshold p &lt; 3.5x10-12 (= 5 x 10-8\/14,342 features). Previously reported associations such as UGT1A1 and bilirubin; PYROXD2 and methyl lysine; ACADS and butyrylcarnitine were successfully replicated in our pediatric cohort. We found potential candidates for novel associations including CSMD1 and a monostearyl alcohol triglyceride; CALN1 and a triglyceride; RBFOX1 and dimethylarginine. A gene-level enrichment analysis using MAGMA revealed highly interconnected modules for ADP biosynthesis, sterol synthesis, and long-chain fatty acid transport in the gene-feature network. Conclusion: Comprehensive profiling of plasma metabolome across age groups combined with genome-wide genotyping revealed a wide range of genetic influence on diverse chemical species and metabolic pathways. The developmental trajectory of a biological system is shaped by gene-environment interaction especially in early life. Therefore, continuous efforts on generating metabolomics data in diverse human tissue types across age groups are required to understand gene-environment interaction toward healthy aging trajectories.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"2072":{"study_id":"ST002334","study_title":"Phospholipase D3 impact on the endolysosomal lipidome","study_type":"","institute":"VIB-KU Leuven","department":"Center for Brain & Disease Research","last_name":"Van Acker","first_name":"Zo\u00eb","email":"zoe.vanacker@kuleuven.vib.be","phone":"+3216320784","submit_date":"2022-10-27","study_summary":"Neurons rely on the endo-lysosomal network for the maintenance of lipid turnover, removal of dysfunctional organelles and the recycling of proteins.

Broccoli sprouts and Brussels sprouts are among the leading cruciferous vegetables under study and contain some similar and some distinct phytochemicals which can activate different, but complementary, mechanisms to promote health. While the cancer-preventative effects of cruciferous vegetables are typically attributed to glucosinolates and their metabolic products, isothiocyanates and indoles, other components of cruciferous vegetables could play a synergistic role in conferring cancer-protective and health promoting effects. Additionally, metabolism of phytochemicals from cruciferous vegetables by the gut microbiome could further lead to the production, inactivation, or clearance of bioactive dietary components. The gut microbiome is essential to the production of bioactive compounds from various food sources. For example, with soy isoflavones and pomegranate urolithins, the presence or absence of specific microbial taxa directly dictates which metabolites are produced (resulting in a metabotype). A similar paradigm could be extended to cruciferous vegetables in which the gut microbiome may play an important role in driving inter-individual metabolism of glucosinolates and isothiocyanates. We recently reported (Bouranis et. al, 2021, Nutrients) that the gut microbiome composition can influence production of glucosinolate-derived nitriles from cruciferous vegetables, showing that the presence or absence of specific microbes can influence the abundance of a single metabolite. Thus, we sought to take an untargeted approach to investigate other phytochemicals from cruciferous vegetables which the gut microbiome could play a role in generating. To investigate plant- and microbe-derived metabolites of cruciferous vegetable digestion and capture information about the microbiome, we utilized an ex vivo fecal incubation system. Broccoli sprouts and Brussels sprouts were in vitro digested using an oral, gastric, and intestinal phase. For fecal bacterial cultivation a 20% fecal slurry (w\/v) was made from fecal material from 10 healthy volunteers (6 female, and 4 male, age 17-51, Lee Biosolutions) and sterile PBS (0.1 M pH 7). 500 \u00b5L of fecal slurry was mixed with 10 mL of Brain Heart Infusion Broth (BHI) with hemin and vitamin K, per the manufacturer\u2019s recommendation, and either 500 \u00b5l of filter sterilized in vitro digested broccoli sprouts (Broc), 500 \u00b5L of filter sterilized in vitro digested Brussels sprouts (Brus), 500 \u00b5L of Broc and 500 \u00b5L of Brus were added (Combo) or a negative control in vitro digestion (NC). NC contained reverse osmosis water, equivalent in volume to the water content of broccoli sprouts and underwent the same in vitro digestion procedure as described above with the same enzymes, chemicals and equipment. Broc and Brus digests were scaled to be equivalent in concentration to a human consuming \u00bd cup of broccoli or Brussels sprouts, or in the case of the combination, \u00bd cup of broccoli sprouts and \u00bd cup of Brussels sprouts. This combination was included as Broc and Brus contain many similar but also some distinct phytochemicals and thus by combining the vegetables we increased the dose and broadened the range of phytochemicals from cruciferous vegetables which can be achieved in the kitchen as a mixed vegetable dish. Fecal cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h in anaerobic conditions.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"2076":{"study_id":"ST002341","study_title":"Metabolomic analysis of colorectal cancer cells using mass spectrometry","study_type":"","institute":"Nanjing Medical University","department":"","last_name":"Zhang","first_name":"Wenjun","email":"zwj941027369@163.com","phone":"+86-025-86868326","submit_date":"2022-10-06","study_summary":"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most prevalent tumors, with a high mortality rate.

While depression etiology is multifactorial, chronic stress is a well-accepted contributor to disease onset. In addition, depression is associated with altered gut microbial signatures that can be replicated in animal models. While targeted restoration of the microbiome has been shown to reduce depressive-like behaviors in mice, the complexity and diversity of the human microbiome has complicated therapeutic intervention in patients. To circumvent these limitations, there is a critical need for identifying pathways responsible for microbiome dysbiosis. Here, for the first time, we identify the changes in host physiology that induce microbiome dysbiosis. Specifically, we show that a component of mucosal layer, the transmembrane protein mucin 13, can regulate microbiome composition. Using a model of chronic stress to induce behavioral and microbial changes in mice, we show a significant reduction in mucin 13 expression across the intestines that occurs independently of the microbiome. Furthermore, deleting Muc13 leads to gut dysbiosis, and baseline behavioral changes normally observed after stress exposure. Together, these results validate the hypothesis that mucosal layer disruption is an initiating event in stress-induced dysbiosis and offer mucin 13 as a potential new therapeutic target for microbiome dysbiosis in stress-induced depression. For the first time, our data provide an upstream and conserved target for treating microbiome dysbiosis, a result with sweeping implications for diseases presenting with microbial alterations.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"2079":{"study_id":"ST002346","study_title":"Lipidomics study of the cells defective in peroxisome division","study_type":"","institute":"Kyushu university","department":"","last_name":"Abe","first_name":"Yuichi","email":"y-abe@bio.sojo-u.ac.jp","phone":"+81926426341","submit_date":"2022-10-26","study_summary":"Proliferation of peroxisomes is accompanied by the growth and division of pre-existing peroxisomes.

Misdiagnosis as bacterial pneumonia commonly occurs in symptomatic Valley fever cases, resulting in inappropriate treatment with antibiotics, increased medical costs, and delay in diagnosis. In this study, we explored the feasibility of developing breath-based diagnostics for Valley fever using a murine lung infection model.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and \uf077-3 marine polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), have been evaluated for their chemopreventive potential in delaying the onset of CRC in high-risk patients. In this study, we determined whether the NSAID, naproxen, alone or in combination with a chemically-stable form of EPA (TP-252), affects tumor formation in the ApcPirc rat model. When compared to control diet, animals fed naproxen or HD TP-252 had 66%, and 82% fewer tumors respectively. However, when fed a combination of naproxen and HD TP-252, animals exhibited a 95% reduction in tumor formation and a 98% reduction in tumor volume, respectively. To elucidate potential mechanisms of tumor protection, a comprehensive, targeted lipidomic analysis was performed on colonic mucosa to determine changes in eicosanoid metabolism. Animals receiving TP-252 alone or in combination with naproxen had significantly reduced mucosal levels of pro-inflammatory \uf077-6 eicosanoids (PGE2, 5-HETE, and 14,15-DiHETrE), along with a simultaneous increase in anti-inflammatory EPA-derived \uf077-3 eicosanoids. Our colonic mucosal lipidomic analysis also uncovered several potential pharmacodynamic (PD) lipid biomarkers, including resolvin E2, 9-HEPE, 12-HEPE and 18-HEPE, that were increased in both the tissue and plasma of rats receiving TP-252 and were significantly correlated with tumor protection.

Analysis of CH12WT B cells in the presence of NH4Cl will identify proteins whose presence is continuously regulated by lysosomes independent of TFG. We determined hundreds of proteins to be controlled by TFG and\/or NH4Cl. Notably, NH4Cl treatment alone increased the abundance of a cluster of cytosolic and mitochondrial translational proteins while it also reduced a number of proteins. Within the B cell relevant protein pool, BCL10 was reduced, while JCHAIN was increased in CH12tfgKO B cells. Furthermore, TFG regulated the abundance of transcription factors, such as JUNB, metabolic enzymes, such as the short-chain fatty acid activating enzyme ACOT9 or the glycolytic enzyme ALDOC. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed that TFG-regulated proteins localized to mitochondria and membrane-bounded organelles. Due to these findings we performed shotgun lipidomics of glycerophospholipids, uncovering that a particular phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) species, PE 32:0, which lipidates LC3 most efficiently, was less abundant while phosphatidylglycerol (PG) was more abundant in CH12tfgKO B cells.

Mitoproteomic analysis revealed profound metabolic disturbances induced by severe hyperglycemia, including upregulation of enzymes involved in the TCA cycle and fatty acid metabolism, enhanced ketogenesis as well as extensive dysregulation of the mitochondrial SLC25 carrier family. The metabolite and lipid landscape were perturbed by severe hyperglycemia; untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics confirmed the enrichment of TCA cycle metabolites, an increase in triglyceride concentrations, and extensive and specific cardiolipin remodeling. Lowering blood glucose to moderate hyperglycemia stabilized all three omic landscapes, partially prevented changes in mitochondrial morphology and bioenergetics, and improved kidney injury.

With clinical specimens, we found that patients with high circLARP2 levels in HCC had advanced prognostic stage and poor overall survival. CircLARP2 facilitated HCC metastasis and lipid accumulation in HCC cell lines. CircLARP2 was one of the rare ones that were identified in HCC metastasis and conserved in mammals, which enabled further studies with animal models. CircLARP2-deficient mice exhibited reduced metastasis and less lipid accumulation in an induced HCC model. We provided lines of evidence at molecular, cellular, and whole organismal levels, to support that circLARP2 functioned as a protein sponge of AUF1. CircLARP2 sequestered AUF1 from binding to LKB1 mRNA, which led to decreased LKB1 mRNA stability and lower LKB1 protein levels. LKB1 as a kinase promoted the phosphorylation of AMPK and then the phosphorylation of ACC, the rate limiting enzyme of fatty acid synthesis. Knockdown of Lkb1 with AAV8-shLkb1 in mice HCC model also proved that Lkb1 was a key element in the regulation.

Rhabdomyolysis is caused by genetic factors that are linked to increased disease susceptibility in response to extrinsic triggers. Recessive mutations in TANGO2 result in episodic rhabdomyolysis, metabolic crises, encephalopathy, and cardiac arrhythmia. The underlying mechanism contributing to disease onset in response to specific triggers remains unclear. To address these challenges, we created a zebrafish model of Tango2 deficiency. Here we demonstrate that the loss of Tango2 in zebrafish results in growth defects, early lethality, and increased susceptibility of muscle defects similar to TANGO2 patients. Detailed analyses of skeletal muscle revealed defects in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria at the onset of disease development. The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) constitutes the primary lipid biosynthesis site and regulates calcium handling in skeletal muscle to control excitation-contraction coupling. Tango2 deficient SR exhibits increased sensitivity to calcium release that was partly restored by inhibition of Ryr1-mediated Ca2+ release in skeletal muscle. Using lipidomics, we identified alterations in the glycerolipid state of tango2 mutants which is critical for membrane stability and energy balance. Therefore, these studies provide insight into key disease processes in Tango2 deficiency and have increased our understanding of the impacts of specific defects on predisposition to environmental triggers in TANGO2-related disorders.","subject_species":"Danio rerio"},"2124":{"study_id":"ST002399","study_title":"Metabolomics of Adipocyte-Conditioned Media Compared to Stromal Cell- and Un-conditioned Media","study_type":"Untargeted MS","institute":"Emory University","department":"Pediatrics","last_name":"Chandler","first_name":"Joshua","email":"joshua.chandler@emory.edu","phone":"404-727-3536","submit_date":"2022-10-21","study_summary":"The metabolomics profiles of adipocyte conditioned media (ACM), stromal cell conditioned media (SCM) and unconditioned media (UCM) were analyzed by untargeted mass spectrometry.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"2125":{"study_id":"ST002400","study_title":"Alcohol dehydrogenase 1B is crucial for adipocyte homeostasis","study_type":"","institute":"INSERM","department":"","last_name":"Gautheron","first_name":"J\u00e9r\u00e9mie","email":"jeremie.gautheron@gmail.com","phone":"+33623398373","submit_date":"2022-12-13","study_summary":"Background. Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH1B), encoded by the ADH1B gene, is a cytosolic enzyme mainly known for its role in ethanol catabolism in the liver. A few studies have paved the way to show an equally important role of ADH1B in adipocytes. This study aimed to better identify the cellular mechanisms and signaling pathways involving ADH1B in adipose tissue and to determine if ADH1B variants might contribute to adipose tissue dysfunction. Results. We showed that CRISPR-Cas9-mediated ADH1B knockout (KO) in human adipose stem cells (ASC) abolished adipocyte differentiation and decreased insulin response. This was accompanied by oxidative stress, altered mitochondrial functions, and cellular senescence. Lipidomic analysis revealed that ADH1B deficiency results in a major remodeling of lipid composition in ASC. An ADH1B homozygous loss-of-function variant was also identified in a patient presenting with a lipodystrophic and insulin resistant syndrome associated with major liver dysfunction, leading to early death. Discussion. This translational study underlines the crucial role of ADH1B in adipose tissue. It unveils cellular mechanisms accounting for its key role in adipogenesis, and adipocyte homeostasis.

Conversely, Xenopus demonstrates RGC lifetime-spanning regenerative capabilities after optic nerve crush, inciting opportunities to compare de novo regeneration and develop efficient pharmaceutical approaches for vision restoration. Studies revealing lipidome alterations during optic nerve regeneration are sparse and could serve as a solid foundation for these underlying molecular changes.

Serum samples from patients at different risk statuses and colorectal cancer growth statuses are studied. Metabolite identification is based on accurate mass matching and\/or retention time of labeled metabolite standards. We quantify 40 metabolites across all the serum samples, including 18 metabolites validated with standards. We find significantly decreased levels of threonine and asparagine in the patients with growing adenomas or high-risk adenomas (p &lt; 0.05). Glutamine levels decrease in patients with adenomas of unknown growth status or high-risk adenomas. In contrast, arginine levels are elevated in patients with low-risk adenoma. Receiver operating characteristic analysis shows high sensitivity and specificity of these metabolites for detecting growing adenomas. Based on these results, we conclude that potential metabolite biomarkers identified here contribute to distinguishing colorectal patients with growing adenomas from normal individuals and patients with unknown growth status of adenomas.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"2138":{"study_id":"ST002421","study_title":"UBXD8 lipidomics from whole cells (Part 1)","study_type":"","institute":"University of Arizona","department":"Immunobiology","last_name":"Purdy","first_name":"John","email":"purdylab@gmail.com","phone":"520-626-4371","submit_date":"2022-12-30","study_summary":"The intimate association between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrial membranes at ER-mitochondria contact sites (ERMCS) serves as a platform for several critical cellular processes, in particular lipid synthesis.

To overcome this challenge, we use the Long Term Evolution Experiment (LTEE) as a model to understand how mutations can transduce themselves through a cellular network, eventually affecting metabolism and perhaps fitness. We used mass-spectropscopy to broadly survey the metabolomes of both ancestors and all 12 evolved lines and combined this with genomic and expression data to suggest how mutations that alter specific reaction pathways, such as the biosynthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, might increase fitness in the system. Our work brings the field closer to a complete genotype-phenotype map for the LTEE and a better understanding of how mutations might affect fitness through the metabolome.

Acute ozone exposure has previously been implicated in airway inflammation, airway hyperreactivity, and other characteristics of asthma. Altered sphingolipid metabolism following ozone exposure may contribute to the molecular mechanisms underlying these previously reported effects. This study aimed to identify changes in metabolomic profiles and characteristics of asthma in allergen-sensitized mice following ozone exposure to provide insights regarding mechanisms of ozone-induced exacerbations in asthma. Adult male and female BALB\/c mice were sensitized intranasally to house dust mite allergen (HDM) on days 1, 3, and 5 followed by HDM challenge on days 12-14. Mice were subsequently exposed to ozone following each HDM challenge for 6 hr\/day. Bronchoalveolar lavage, plasma, whole lung lobes, and microdissected lung airways were collected from 8 female and 8 male mice for metabolomics analysis. 6 female and 6 male mice underwent methacholine challenge using a forced oscillation technique to assess pulmonary function. HDM-sensitized male mice exposed to ozone displayed synergistically increased airway hyperreactivity as well as increased airway inflammation and eosinophilia relative to control mice. Effects in male mice were significantly more severe than the effects observed in females. Both HDM-sensitized male and female mice exposed to ozone displayed significant decreases in multiple classes of sphingolipids in microdissected airways. However, glycosphingolipids were significantly increased in females and to a lesser extent in males. These results potentially implicate glycosphingolipids in protecting against severe outcomes of ozone exposure that coincide with exacerbation of allergic asthma.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"2154":{"study_id":"ST002442","study_title":"Alterations in CSF Urea Occur in Late Manifest Stage Huntington Disease","study_type":"untargeted metabolomics analysis","institute":"Vanderbilt University","department":"Chemistry","last_name":"CODREANU","first_name":"SIMONA","email":"SIMONA.CODREANU@VANDERBILT.EDU","phone":"6158758422","submit_date":"2023-01-12","study_summary":"Huntington Disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by expanded cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeats in the Huntingtin gene, resulting in the production of mutant huntingtin proteins (mHTT).

The exact timing of these elevations in urea and the molecular mechanism(s) responsible for these disturbances remain unknown. To better understand the pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for elevations in urea in HD, we completed a global metabolomic profile of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from individuals who were at several stages of disease: pre-manifest (PRE), manifest (MAN), and late-manifest (LATE) HD participants compared to controls. We found approximately 500 metabolites were significantly altered in pre-manifest participants compared to controls, although no significant difference in CSF urea or urea metabolites. Interestingly, CSF urea was only significantly elevated in LATE participants compared to controls. There were no changes in the urea metabolites, citrulline, ornithine and arginine throughout disease; however, we did observe changes in acetate, creatinine, 4-acetamidobutanoate and 4-aminobutyraldehyde which are indirect modifiers of urea. Overall, our study confirms that elevations in urea do occur in HD, albeit later in disease and that these changes may reflect more central impairments to cellular energy metabolism yet to be explored.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"2155":{"study_id":"ST002444","study_title":"Zebrafish Optic Nerve Regeneration Metabolomics - 3 Days Post Crush","study_type":"","institute":"University of Miami","department":"McKnight - Ophthalmology","last_name":"Bhattacharya","first_name":"Sanjoy","email":"sbhattacharya@med.miami.edu","phone":"3054824103","submit_date":"2022-12-19","study_summary":"Zebrafish (Danio Rerio) have the capacity for successful adult optic nerve regeneration.

Based on the simple observation that miR-142 levels are significantly lower in CD34+CD38- cells from blast crisis (BC) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). CML patients compared with chronic phase (CP) CML patients (p=0.002), we hypothesized that miR-142 deficit plays a role in BC transformation. To test this hypothesis, we generated a miR-142 KO BCR-ABL (i.e., miR-142\u2212\/\u2212BCR-ABL) mouse by crossing a miR-142\u2212\/\u2212 mouse with a miR-142+\/+BCR-ABL mouse. While the miR-142+\/+BCR-ABL mice developed and died of CP CML, the miR-142\u2212\/\u2212BCR-ABL mice developed a BC-like phenotype in the absence of any other acquired gene mutations and died significantly sooner than miR-142+\/+BCR-ABL CP controls (p=0.001). Leukemic stem cell (LSC)-enriched Lineage-Sca-1+c-Kit+ cells (LSKs) from diseased miR-142\u2212\/\u2212BCR-ABL mice transplanted into congenic recipients, recapitulated the BC features thereby suggesting stable transformation of CP-LSCs into BC-LSCs in the miR-142 KO CML mouse. Single cell (sc) RNA-seq profiling showed that miR-142 deficit changed the cellular landscape of the miR-142\u2212\/\u2212BCR-ABL LSKs compared with miR-142+\/+BCR-ABL LSKs with expansion of myeloid-primed and loss of lymphoid-primed factions. Bulk RNA-seq analyses along with unbiased metabolomic profiling and functional metabolic assays demonstrated enhanced fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation (FAO) and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) in miR-142\u2212\/\u2212BCR-ABL LSKs vs miR-142+\/+BCR-ABL LSKs. MiR-142 deficit enhanced FAO in miR-142\u2212\/\u2212BCR-ABL LSKs by increasing the expression of CPT1A and CPT1B, that controls the cytosol-to-mitochondrial acyl-carnitine transport, a critical step in FAO. MiR-142 deficit also enhanced OxPhos in miR-142\u2212\/\u2212BCR-ABL LSKs by increasing mitochondrial fusion and activity. As the homeostasis and activity of LSCs depend on higher levels of these oxidative metabolism processes, we then postulate that miR-142 deficit is a potentially druggable target for BC-LSCs. To this end, we developed a novel CpG-miR-142 mimic oligonucleotide (ODN; i.e., CpG-M-miR-142) that corrected the miR-142 deficit and alone or in combination with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) significantly reduced LSC burden and prolonged survival of miR-142\u2212\/\u2212BCR-ABL mice. The results from murine models were validated in BC CD34+CD38- primary blasts and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). In conclusion, an acquired miR-142 deficit sufficed in transforming CP-LSCs into BC-LSCs, via enhancement of bioenergetic oxidative metabolism in absence of any additional gene mutations, and likely represent a novel therapeutic target in BC CML.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"2158":{"study_id":"ST002447","study_title":"Bioactive molecule(s) of gut bacteria of Crocodile (Crocodylus palustris) as potential pharmaceuticals","study_type":"","institute":"Sharjah Institute for Medical Research","department":"","last_name":"Facility","first_name":"Core","email":"tims-tof@sharjah.ac.ae","phone":"+971 6 5057656","submit_date":"2022-12-22","study_summary":"Crocodiles thrive in unsanitary conditions, feed on rotten meat, are exposed to heavy metals and are among the very few species to endure the catastrophic Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction event, and yet they can live up to 100 years.

Next, bacterial conditioned media containing gut microbial metabolites were prepared. Bioassay-guided testing of selected bacterial conditioned media using LC-TIMS-QTOF MS, revealed the identity of gut microbial metabolites. Among two bacterial conditioned media, i.e., CP27 and 36, the analyses resulted in 141 highly confidently (MS\/MS) identified metabolites in both samples. The pairwise comparison of the two samples indicated that 109 metabolites change significantly between them (p &lt;0.05).

We investigated this mechanism in a cultured endothelial cell hypoxia-reoxygenation model, in a rat model of hemorrhage, and in trauma patient plasma samples.

Although this treatment is known to trigger pro-inflammatory immune responses, it also results in several immune resistance mechanisms such as the upregulation of CD47 by tumors leading to avoidance of phagocytosis and the overexpression of PD-L1 in tumor-associated myeloid cells (TAMCs). Leveraging these RT-elicited processes, we generated a bispecific-lipid nanoparticle (B-LNP) that engaged TAMCs to glioma cells via anti-CD47\/PD-L1 dual-ligation. We show that B-LNP blocked these two vital immune checkpoint molecules and promoted the phagocytic activity of TAMCs. In order to boost subsequent T cell recruitment and antitumor activity after tumor engulfment, the B-LNP was encapsulated with diABZI, a non-nucleotidyl agonist for stimulator of interferon genes (STING). In vivo treatment with the diABZI-loaded B-LNP induced a transcriptomic and metabolic switch in TAMCs, transforming them into potent antitumor effector cells, which induced T cell infiltration and activation of in the brain tumors. In preclinical murine glioma models, B-LNP therapy significantly potentiated the antitumor effects of radiotherapy, promoted brain tumor regression, and induced immunological memory against gliomas. The nano37 therapy was efficacious through both intra-tumoral and systemic delivery routes. In summary, our study shows a unique nanotechnology-based approach that hijacks multiple immune checkpoints to boost potent and long-lasting antitumor immunity against GBM.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"2174":{"study_id":"ST002468","study_title":"First approach on the use of samples from fecal occult blood screening kits for metabolomic analysis.

In order to facilitate the progression treatment and underpin comprehension of toxicity, fundamental understanding of the disruption to normal cellular biochemistry and trafficking is needed. Here, by removing the complex biochemistry of the brain, we have utilised known prion forming strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae carrying different conformational variants of the Rnq1p to obtain Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolic profiles and identify key perturbations of prion presence. These studies reveal that prion containing [RNQ+] cells display a significant reduction in amino acid biosynthesis and distinct perturbations in sphingolipid metabolism, with significant downregulation in metabolites within these pathways. Moreover, that native Rnq1p downregulates ubiquinone biosynthesis pathways within cells, suggesting that Rnq1p may play a lipid\/mevalonate-based cytoprotective role as a regulator of ubiquinone production. These findings contribute to the understanding of how prion proteins interact in vivo in both their prion and non-prion confirmations and indicate potential targets for the mitigation of these effects. . We demonstrate specific sphingolipid centred metabolic disruptions due to prion presence and give insight into a potential cytoprotective role of the native Rnq1 protein.

This includes firefighting foams, flame retardants, utensil coatings and waterproofing of food packaging. PFAS exposure aberrantly modulates lipid, metabolite and bile acid (BA) levels, increasing susceptibility to onset and severity of metabolic diseases, such as diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). To date, most studies in humans have focused on PFAS-exposure effects in adults. In this study we now demonstrate that PFAS are present in the human fetal liver and that they have metabolic consequences for the human fetus. Methods Human fetal livers from elective termination of pregnancies between 11-19 weeks of gestation (n = 78) were analysed by both targeted and untargeted metabolomic analyses of lipids, polar metabolites, BAs and PFAS. Stringent bioinformatic and statistical methods were applied to this data to generate a network of interacting molecules. Findings Metabolites associated with PFAS were identified in the fetal liver and these varied with gestational age . Conjugated BAs were markedly positively associated with fetal age. Several amino acids, fatty acids and sugar derivatives in fetal livers were inversely associated with PFAS exposure, while the BA glycolithocholic acid (GLCA) was markedly positively associated with all quantified PFAS. Furthermore, 7\u03b1-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4), a marker of BA synthesis rate, was strongly positively associated with PFAS levels and was detectable as early as gestational week 12. Interpretation The data show direct evidence for in-utero effects of PFAS exposure on specific key hepatic products. Our results provide evidence that PFAS exposure, with potential future consequences, manifests in the human fetus as early as the first trimester of gestation. Furthermore, the profiles of metabolic changes resemble those observed in perinatal PFAS exposures. Such exposures are already linked with susceptibility, initiation, progression and\/or exacerbation of a wide range of metabolic diseases.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"2183":{"study_id":"ST002481","study_title":"Urolithin A (UroA) acts at CYP1A1\/1B1 substrates leading to enhanced aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) activity in vivo","study_type":"","institute":"Pennsylvania State University","department":"","last_name":"DONG","first_name":"FANGCONG","email":"fxd93@psu.edu","phone":"8146990203","submit_date":"2023-02-16","study_summary":"Many AHR ligands are CYP1A1\/1B1 substrates, which can result in the rapid clearance within the intestinal tract and other tissues, limiting both the level and duration of AHR activation.

We characterized metabolomic profiles in ASD using plasma samples collected in the Norwegian Autism Birth Cohort from mothers at weeks 17-21 gestation (maternal mid-gestation, MMG, n=408) and from children on the day of birth (cord blood, CB, n=418). We analyzed associations using sex-stratified adjusted logistic regression models with Bayesian analyses. Chemical enrichment analyses (ChemRICH) were performed to determine altered chemical clusters. We also employed machine learning algorithms to assess the utility of metabolomics as ASD biomarkers. We identified ASD associations with a variety of chemical compounds including arachidonic acid, glutamate, and glutamine, and metabolite clusters including hydroxy eicospentaenoic acids, phosphatidylcholines, and ceramides in MMG and CB plasma that are consistent with inflammation, disruption of membrane integrity, and impaired neurotransmission and neurotoxicity. Girls with ASD have disruption of ether\/non-ether phospholipid balance in the MMG plasma that is similar to that found in other neurodevelopmental disorders. ASD boys in the CB analyses had the highest number of dysregulated chemical clusters. Machine learning classifiers distinguished ASD cases from controls with AUC values ranging from 0.710 to 0.853. Predictive performance was better in CB analyses than in MMG. These findings may provide new insights into the sex-specific differences in ASD and have implications for discovery of biomarkers that may enable early diagnosis and intervention.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"2186":{"study_id":"ST002485","study_title":"Simultaneous targeting of PD-1 and IL2R\u03b2\u03b3 with radiation therapy to inhibit pancreatic cancer growth and metastasis - mouse serum metabolomics","study_type":"","institute":"University of Colorado Denver","department":"","last_name":"Haines","first_name":"Julie","email":"julie.haines@cuanschutz.edu","phone":"3037243339","submit_date":"2023-02-21","study_summary":"Mice were orthotopically implanted with PK5L1940 cells then radiation therapy (8 Gy) administered 7 days post-implantation.

Apical FA interaction with EC CD36 induces actin reorganization, caveolin-1 tyrosine 14 (Cav-1Y14) phosphorylation, and ceramide generation in caveolae, culminating in caveolae internalization into FA\/CD36\/ceramide vesicles that are secreted basolaterally as small extracellular vesicles, sEVs (exosomes). In transwells, ECs expressing fluorescent CD63 (exosomal marker) transfer FAs to underlying myotubes in CD63-labeled sEVs. In vivo FA-CD63-CD36 transfer from ECs to muscle is shown using a mouse with EC-specific expression of emGFP-CD63. CD36 depletion, actin-binding latrunculin-B, Src inhibition, Cav-1Y14 mutation, and membrane neutral sphingomyelinase inhibition by GW4869 helped map the FA-sEV pathway.

But the mechanisms by which MUFAs extend lifespan remain unclear. Here we show that an organelle network involving lipid droplets and peroxisomes is critical for lifespan extension by MUFAs in C. elegans. MUFA accumulation increases lipid droplet number in fat storage tissues, and this is necessary for MUFA-induced longevity. Lipid droplet number in young or middle-aged individuals can predict remaining lifespan, consistent with a beneficial effect of lipid droplets on lifespan. Lipidomics datasets reveal that MUFA accumulation also modifies the ratio of membrane lipids and ether lipids, a signature predictive of decreased lipid oxidation. We validate that MUFAs decrease lipid oxidation in middle-aged individuals, and that this is important for MUFA-induced longevity. Intriguingly, the increase in lipid droplet number in response to MUFAs is accompanied by a concomitant increase in peroxisome number. Using a targeted screen, we identify genes involved in the co-regulation or uncoupling of this lipid droplet-peroxisome network. We find that induction of both organelles is optimal for lifespan extension. Our study uncovers an organelle network involved in lipid homeostasis and lifespan regulation and identifies a mechanism of action for MUFAs to extend lifespan, opening new avenues for lipid-based interventions to delay aging.

However, evolutionarily conserved circRNAs with potent functions in cancers are rarely reported. Here, we identified a mammalian conserved circRNA circLARP2 that played critical roles in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). With clinical specimens, we found that patients with high circLARP2 levels in HCC had advanced prognostic stage and poor overall survival. CircLARP2 facilitated HCC metastasis and lipid accumulation in HCC cell lines. CircLARP2 was one of the rare ones that were identified in HCC metastasis and conserved in mammals, which enabled further studies with animal models. CircLARP2-deficient mice exhibited reduced metastasis and less lipid accumulation in an induced HCC model. We provided lines of evidence at molecular, cellular, and whole organismal levels, to support that circLARP2 functioned as a protein sponge of AUF1. CircLARP2 sequestered AUF1 from binding to LKB1 mRNA, which led to decreased LKB1 mRNA stability and lower LKB1 protein levels. LKB1 as a kinase promoted the phosphorylation of AMPK and then the phosphorylation of ACC, the rate limiting enzyme of fatty acid synthesis. Knockdown of Lkb1 with AAV8-shLkb1 in mice HCC model also proved that Lkb1 was a key element in the regulation. Through this AUF1-LKB1-AMPK-ACC pathway, circLARP2 promoted HCC metastasis and lipid accumulation.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"2203":{"study_id":"ST002506","study_title":"Natural abundance of isotopic metabolite detection in mouse eye orgnaoids.","study_type":"","institute":"Northwestern University","department":"","last_name":"TAKATA","first_name":"NOZOMU","email":"nozomu.takata@northwestern.edu","phone":"3125036066","submit_date":"2023-03-15","study_summary":"Because the natural abundance of isotopic metabolites in the early eye organoids has not yet been reported, we have performed LC-MS\/MS without exogenous isotopic labeling to show the natural abundance of isotopic carbons.

Substantially better results are observed when women with OC are correctly diagnosed and ensured the right treatment. However, non-specific symptoms along with our lack of understanding of OC pathogenesis hinder its diagnosis, consequently leading to a very low survival rate. Accumulating evidence suggests the link between OC and deregulated lipid metabolism. Most studies, however, are limited by small sample sizes and metabolite coverage, thereby constraining the robustness of the results. Here, we performed a comprehensive serum lipidome profiling of OC and various other gynecological malignancies (non-OC). A relatively large patient cohort with 208 OC and 137 non-OC patients, including 93 OC patients with early-stage OC, was recruited from two independent clinical sites in South Korea. Samples were analyzed with high-coverage liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry, providing extensive lipidome coverage with 994 successfully annotated lipid features. Lipidome differences between OC and other gynecological malignancies were investigated via statistical and machine learning approaches. Our data suggest that lipidome alterations unique to OC can be detected as early as when the cancer is localized, and those changes amplify as the diseases progresses. Comparison of the relative lipid abundances revealed specific patterns based on lipid class with most lipid classes showing decreased abundance in ovarian cancer. This study provides a systemic analysis of lipidome alterations in OC, emphasizing the potential of circulating lipids as a complementary class of blood-based biomarkers for OC diagnosis.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"2219":{"study_id":"ST002523","study_title":"Candida expansion in the human gut is associated with an ecological signature that supports growth under dysbiotic conditions","study_type":"","institute":"Leibniz Institute for Natural Product Research and Infection Biology Hans Kn\u00f6ll Institute (Leibniz-HKI)","department":"Microbiome Dynamics","last_name":"Bastian","first_name":"Seelbinder","email":"bastian.seelbinder@leibniz-hki.de","phone":"+4936415321360","submit_date":"2023-03-23","study_summary":"The overgrowth of Candida species in the human gut is considered a prerequisite for invasive candidiasis.

In conclusion, our study supports the incorporation of microwave fixation to study terminal brain metabolism in rodent models.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"2222":{"study_id":"ST002526","study_title":"Stable isotope tracing of 15N2-glutamine in orthotopic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma tumor bearing mice and non tumor-bearing controls","study_type":"","institute":"University of Chicago","department":"","last_name":"Apiz Saab","first_name":"Juan","email":"japizsaab@uchicago.edu","phone":"7738346506","submit_date":"2022-08-05","study_summary":"Stable isotope tracing by bolus intravenous injections of 15N2-glutamine in orthotopic PDAC tumor bearing mice and non tumor-bearing controls followed by plasma sampling and tumor extraction for analysis of intratumoral metabolite labeling during the period of kinetic labeling","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"2223":{"study_id":"ST002527","study_title":"HPLC-MS-MS analysis amino acid levels in PDAC IF samples upon arginase inhibition","study_type":"","institute":"University of Chicago","department":"","last_name":"Apiz Saab","first_name":"Juan","email":"japizsaab@uchicago.edu","phone":"7738346506","submit_date":"2022-08-05","study_summary":"To test the hypothesis that myeloid arginase-1 activity could be responsible for pancreatic ductal adenocarninoma microenvironmental arginine starvation (PMID: 30990168), we generated orthotopic allograft mPDAC tumors in a mouse model with myeloid specific Arg1 knockout (LysM-Cre+\/+-; Arg1fl\/fl) and control animals (Arg1fl\/fl).

The high productivity of purslane, when grown in controlled-environment agriculture, can open many opportunities for the purslane industry, even in the context of biosaline agriculture. Building up a robust multi-omics database on the response of purslane to salt stress and the subsequent study of it via an MOI analysis can create the basis for a future system biology approach to decode the genetics behind its resistance to salinity stress. The present study is a second step in building a robust database on the morpho-physiological and molecular responses of Portulaca oleracea L. to salinity stress and its subsequent use in attempting to decode the genetics behind its resistance to this abiotic stress. After reporting on the characterization of the morpho-physiological responses of young purslane plants to such stress using a robust salinization protocol, here we report a study on adult purslane plants through the characterization of the untargeted metabolome and proteome profiles on the leaves and roots of this halophyte species submitted to very high salinity stress, and the consequent use of single- and multi-omics analysis strategies to study it.","subject_species":"Portulaca oleracea"},"2233":{"study_id":"ST002539","study_title":"Microbial metabolomic responses to changes in temperature and salinity along the western Antarctic Peninsula.","study_type":"Study of particulate metabolites in phytoplankton and sea-ice algae along the Western Antarctic Peninsula","institute":"University of Washington, School of Oceanography","department":"School of Oceanography","last_name":"Dawson","first_name":"Hannah","email":"hmdawson@uw.edu","phone":"5404547754","submit_date":"2023-03-27","study_summary":"Seasonal cycles within the marginal ice zones in polar regions include large shifts in temperature and salinity that strongly influence microbial abundance and physiology.

Coastal marine communities along the western Antarctic Peninsula were sampled and surface seawater was incubated at combinations of temperature and salinity mimicking the formation (cold, salty) and melting (warm, fresh) of sea ice to evaluate how these factors may shape community composition and particulate metabolite pools during seasonal transitions. Bacterial and algal community structures were tightly coupled to each other and distinct across sea-ice, seawater, and sea-ice-meltwater field samples, with unique metabolite profiles in each habitat. During short-term (approximately 10-day) incubations of seawater microbial communities under different temperature and salinity conditions, community compositions changed minimally while metabolite pools shifted greatly, strongly accumulating compatible solutes like proline and glycine betaine under cold and salty conditions. Lower salinities reduced total metabolite concentrations in particulate matter, which may indicate a release of metabolites into the labile dissolved organic matter pool. Low salinity also increased acylcarnitine concentrations in particulate matter, suggesting a potential for fatty acid degradation and reduced nutritional value at the base of the food web during freshening.

We further established an hPSC-based model of DPN that revealed the selective vulnerability of human SCs to hyperglycemia-induced cytotoxicity. By high-throughput screening we found bupropion counteracts glucose-mediated cytotoxicity in SCs and normalizes glucose-induced transcriptional and metabolic abnormalities in SCs. Treatment of hyperglycemic mice with bupropion rescued sensory function, prevented SC death, and counteracted myelin damage in sciatic nerves.

Cancer cell metabolism plays a critical role in tumor growth and progression, and metabolic alterations in cancer cells have been implicated in treatment resistance. In this study, we performed metabolomic analysis using ovarian cancer cells derived from patients in the United States and Korea. Our results reveal significant ethnic-specific differences in the metabolic signatures of ovarian cancer cells, with differential regulation of metabolites derived from glycolytic pathways, lipid metabolism, and microbiome modified metabolites. These findings have important therapeutic implications, as differences in ovarian cancer metabolism between ethnic groups may influence treatment response and resistance. Targeting the unique metabolic signatures of ovarian cancer cells based on ethnic specificity may improve the effectiveness of precision medicine approaches in the treatment of ovarian cancer. This study highlights the potential for personalized and targeted therapeutic options based on the tumor metabolome and ethnic background of the patient. Overall, our results suggest that investigating ethnic-specific differences in cancer metabolism is critical for developing effective and personalized cancer therapies. The identification of unique metabolic signatures in ovarian cancer cells based on ethnic specificity provides a promising avenue for improving treatment outcomes and advancing the field of precision medicine in ovarian cancer.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"2249":{"study_id":"ST002556","study_title":"Blood metabolomics and impacted cellular mechanisms during transition into lactation in dairy cows that develop metritis","study_type":"Case-Control Study","institute":"University of Florida","department":"College of Veterinary Medicine","last_name":"segundocasaro","first_name":"Segundo","email":"segundocasaro@ufl.edu","phone":"3522844016","submit_date":"2023-04-11","study_summary":"The objective of this study was to identify metabolites associated with metritis and use them for identification of cellular mechanisms affected during transition into lactation.

Cows with reddish or brownish, watery, and fetid discharge were diagnosed with metritis (n = 52). Cows with metritis were paired with herdmates without metritis (n = 52) based on DIM. The metabolome of plasma samples was evaluated using untargeted gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Univariate analyses included t-tests and fold change analyses. Metabolites with false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted P \u2264 0.10 on t-tests were used for partial least squares \u2013 discriminant analysis PLS-DA coupled with permutational analysis using 2,000 permutations. Metabolites with FDR adjusted P \u2264 0.10 on t-tests were also used for enriched pathway analyses and identification of cellular processes. Cows that developed metritis had affected cellular processes associated with lower amino acid metabolism in the prepartum period, greater lipolysis, cell death, and oxidative stress at calving and at metritis diagnosis, and greater leukocyte activation at calving, but lower immune cell activation at metritis diagnosis. In summary, cows that developed metritis had plasma metabolomic changes associated with greater lipolysis, oxidative stress, and a dysregulated immune response which may predispose cows to metritis development.","subject_species":"Bos taurus"},"2250":{"study_id":"ST002557","study_title":"Untargeted Metabolomics Identifies Biomarkers for MCADD Neonates in Dried Blood Spots","study_type":"Newborn screening","institute":"King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre (KFSHRC)","department":"","last_name":"AlMalki","first_name":"Reem","email":"439203044@student.ksu.edu.sa","phone":"0534045397","submit_date":"2023-04-11","study_summary":"Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) is the most common inherited mitochondrial metabolic disease of fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation, especially in newborns. MCADD is clinically diagnosed using Newborn Bloodspot Screening (NBS) and genetic testing. Still, these methods have limitations, such as false negatives or positives in NBS and variants of uncertain significance in genetic testing. Thus, complementary diagnostic approaches for MCADD are needed. Recently, untargeted metabolomics has been proposed as a diagnostic approach for inherited metabolic diseases (IMDs) due to its ability to detect a wide range of metabolic alterations. We performed untargeted metabolic profiling of dried blood spots (DBS) from MCADD newborns (n=14) and healthy controls (n=14) to discover potential metabolic biomarkers\/pathways associated with MCADD. Extracted metabolites from DBS samples were analyzed using UPLC-QToF-MS for untargeted metabolomics analyses. Multivariate and univariate analyses were used to analyze the metabolomics data, and pathway and biomarker analyses were also performed on the significantly endogenous identified metabolites. MCADD newborns had 1034 significantly dysregulated metabolites compared to healthy newborns (Moderated t-test, no correction, p-value \u2264 0.05, FC 1.5). 23 endogenous metabolites were upregulated, while 84 endogenous metabolites were downregulated. Pathway analyses showed phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis as the most affected pathway. Potential metabolic biomarkers for MCADD were PGP (a21:0\/PG\/F1alpha) and glutathione with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.949 and 0.898, respectively. PGP (a21:0\/PG\/F1alpha) was the only oxidized lipid in the top-15 biomarker list with the highest p-value and FC. Also, glutathione was chosen to indicate oxidative stress events that could happen during fatty acid oxidation defects. Our findings suggest that MCADD newborns may have oxidative stress events as signs of the disease. However, further validations of these biomarkers are needed in future studies to ensure their accuracy and reliability as complementary markers with established MCADD markers for clinical diagnosis.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"2251":{"study_id":"ST002560","study_title":"Hydroxylated acylcarnitines as potential biomarkers for VLCADD newborn patients in Saudi Arabia","study_type":"","institute":"King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre (KFSHRC)","department":"","last_name":"AlMalki","first_name":"Reem","email":"439203044@student.ksu.edu.sa","phone":"0534045397","submit_date":"2023-04-11","study_summary":"Very long acylcarnitine dehydrogenase deficiency (VLCADD) is an inherited metabolic disorder related to fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation. It is characterized by genetic mutations in ACADVL gene and accumulations of acylcarnitines. VLCADD can be developed in the neonatal period or during adulthood. Certain diagnostic approaches are used to confirm the diagnosis of VLCADD including genetic sequencing and newborn bloodspot screening (NBS). The last two approaches have shown some limitations such as VUS with genetic sequencing and false positive or negative results in NBS. Therefore, there are demands for additional diagnostic tools for VLCADD. Since VLCADD is associated with disrupted metabolism, untargeted metabolomics, which is an analytical technique used to detect a large-scale profiling of metabolites in biological samples, could be a useful tool for diagnosis. We hypothesized that VLCADD newborns patients may exhibit a unique metabolic profile and biomarkers compared to healthy newborns. Untargeted metabolomics approach was conducted using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to measure the global metabolites in DBS cards collected from VLCADD newborns (n=15) and healthy controls (n=15).

Here, we show that apart from glycosylation abnormalities, PMM2 deficiency also leads to changes in intracellular glucose flux, which results in an increase in intracellular polyols such as sorbitol and mannitol.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"2266":{"study_id":"ST002577","study_title":"Hydroxyproline Modulates Adaptive PD-L1 Expression and Autophagy","study_type":"","institute":"Scripps Research Institute\/University of California, Los Angeles","department":"","last_name":"Palermo","first_name":"Amelia","email":"apalermo@mednet.ucla.edu","phone":"8582811389","submit_date":"2023-04-10","study_summary":"The immune checkpoint protein PD-L1 plays critical roles in both immune system homeostasis and tumor progression. Impaired PD-1\/PD-L1 function promotes autoimmunity and PD-L1 expression within tumors promotes immune evasion. If and how changes in metabolism or defined metabolites regulate PD-L1 expression is not fully understood. Here, using a metabolomics activity screening-based approach, we have determined that hydroxyproline (Hyp) significantly and directly enhances adaptive (i.e., IFN-\u03b3 induced) PD-L1 expression in multiple relevant myeloid and cancer cell types. Mechanistic studies reveal that Hyp acts as an inhibitor of IFN-\u03b3-induced autophagic flux, which allows it to regulate this negative feedback mechanism, thereby contributing to its overall effect on PD-L1 expression. Due to its prevalence in fibrotic tumors, these findings suggest that hydroxyproline could contribute to the establishment of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and that Hyp metabolism could be targeted to pharmacologically control PD-L1 expression for the treatment of cancer or autoimmune diseases.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"2267":{"study_id":"ST002578","study_title":"Steady State Metabolomics Study in SMARCA4 mutant(BIN-67) cells cultured in the absence of glucose or glutamine","study_type":"","institute":"McGill University","department":"Biochemistry","last_name":"Fu","first_name":"Zheng","email":"zheng.fu2@mail.mcgill.ca","phone":"5143985446","submit_date":"2023-04-24","study_summary":"steady-state abundances of all TCA cycle intermediates were more severely reduced in BIN-67 cells deprived of glutamine than those deprived of glucose","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"2268":{"study_id":"ST002579","study_title":"MoTrPAC: Endurance exercise training study in young adult rats, Tissue:Plasma - Targeted Amines","study_type":"","institute":"Mayo Clinic","department":"Internal Medicine","last_name":"Nair","first_name":"K.

Thirty-eight significantly altered metabolites (24 down-, 14 up-regulated, P &lt; 0.05) were identified in the Zn-treated vs Zn-untreated esophagus. Of the 24 down-regulated metabolites, 15 (63%) were involved in anabolic\/biosynthetic pathways, including amino acid\/pyrimidine\/purine metabolism and polyamine biosynthesis. Putrescine (intermediate in polyamine biosynthesis), shown to be up 6.4-fold in ESCC-bearing ZD esophagus (3), was down-regulated -3.96-fold in Zn-treated esophagus. Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is the rate liming enzyme in the polyamine biosynthetic pathway to form putrescine, which is converted into spermidine and spermine. Polyamines are indispensable for cell proliferation\/tumor growth, and depletion of polyamines inhibits tumor growth (6). Of the 14 metabolites that were significantly up-regulated in the Zn-treated esophagus, five (37%) were carbohydrates, including glucose, which is up-regulated 3.4-fold, pointing to a decreased uptake of glucose and a reversal of the Warburg effect after Zn treatment. Critical to cancer aerobic glycolysis is the metabolic enzyme hexokinase 2 (HK2) that catalyzes the first committed step in glucose metabolism where glucose is phosphorylated to form glucose-6-phosphate. HK2 overexpression accounts for the high glycolytic rate in cancer cells (7). In summary, Zn treatment that significantly reduced ESCC incidence reversed classic cancer cell metabolic phenotypes such as increased glycolysis and nucleoside intermediates, with decrease in putrescine, increase in glucose, accompanied by down-regulation of metabolite enzymes ODC and HK2.","subject_species":"Rattus norvegicus"},"2275":{"study_id":"ST002586","study_title":"Stable isotope tracer analysis (SITA) using 13C6-glucose and 13C5-glutamine measured by GC\/MS in BIN-67 cells \u00b1 SMARCA4 restoration","study_type":"","institute":"McGill University","department":"Biochemistry","last_name":"Fu","first_name":"Zheng","email":"zheng.fu2@mail.mcgill.ca","phone":"5143985446","submit_date":"2023-04-25","study_summary":"SMARCA4\/2-loss drives the metabolic shift preferring glutamine than glucose to sustain the TCA cycle.

Rats were exercised on the rodent treadmill 5 days per week using a progressive training protocol designed to exercise the rats at approximately 70% of VO2max as outlined in the Table on the next page. Training was performed no earlier than 10:00 am and no later than 5:00 pm over 5 consecutive days per week. Training was initiated with the treadmill set at 70% of VO2 max (see tables) and 5 degrees grade for 20 minutes. The duration of exercise was increased by one minute each day until day 31 of training (start of week 7), when a duration of 50 min was reached. Speed and grade of each training session increased in larger increments due to treadmill parameters. The highest intensity and duration of training began on day 31. This intensity was maintained for the final 10 days of the protocol to ensure steady state had been achieved. If any rats were unable to perform at least 4 days of training per week they were removed from the study and euthanized. It is important to note that the starting treadmill speed varied depending on the sex and age of the rat. The initial and maximum speeds were based on VO2max measurements obtained during the pre-training testing of the compliant rats. Rats assigned to the control group followed a schedule similar to the training group. They were placed in one lane on the treadmill for 15 minutes\/day, 5 days per week.

For the older age group, an additional set of controls (n=5-6) were collected with the 1-2 week training group. Rats were either sedentary or underwent an exercise training program. Rats were exercised on the rodent treadmill 5 days per week using a progressive training protocol designed to exercise the rats at approximately 70% of VO2max as outlined in the Table on the next page. Training was performed no earlier than 10:00 am and no later than 5:00 pm over 5 consecutive days per week. Training was initiated with the treadmill set at 70% of VO2 max (see tables) and 5 degrees grade for 20 minutes. The duration of exercise was increased by one minute each day until day 31 of training (start of week 7), when a duration of 50 min was reached. Speed and grade of each training session increased in larger increments due to treadmill parameters. The highest intensity and duration of training began on day 31. This intensity was maintained for the final 10 days of the protocol to ensure steady state had been achieved. If any rats were unable to perform at least 4 days of training per week they were removed from the study and euthanized. It is important to note that the starting treadmill speed varied depending on the sex and age of the rat. The initial and maximum speeds were based on VO2max measurements obtained during the pre-training testing of the compliant rats. Rats assigned to the control group followed a schedule similar to the training group. They were placed in one lane on the treadmill for 15 minutes\/day, 5 days per week. The treadmill was set at 0 m\/min at an incline that corresponded to the incline being used by the training group.","subject_species":"Rattus norvegicus"},"2319":{"study_id":"ST002630","study_title":"MoTrPAC: Endurance exercise training study in young adult rats, Tissue:Plasma - Untargeted Lipidomics, Reversed-Phase Negative","study_type":"","institute":"Georgia Institute of Technology","department":"Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry","last_name":"Facundo","first_name":"Fernandez","email":"facundo.fernandez@chemistry.gatech.edu","phone":"(404) 385-4432","submit_date":"2023-04-25","study_summary":"The goal of the endurance exercise training study in young adult rats (internal code: PASS1B-06) was to perform exercise training studies in adult (6 month) F344 rats, and from these rats collect as many tissues as feasible in order to provide high quality samples for detailed analysis by chemical analysis sites.

For the older age group, an additional set of controls (n=5-6) were collected with the 1-2 week training group. Rats were either sedentary or underwent an exercise training program. Rats were exercised on the rodent treadmill 5 days per week using a progressive training protocol designed to exercise the rats at approximately 70% of VO2max as outlined in the Table on the next page. Training was performed no earlier than 10:00 am and no later than 5:00 pm over 5 consecutive days per week. Training was initiated with the treadmill set at 70% of VO2 max (see tables) and 5 degrees grade for 20 minutes. The duration of exercise was increased by one minute each day until day 31 of training (start of week 7), when a duration of 50 min was reached. Speed and grade of each training session increased in larger increments due to treadmill parameters. The highest intensity and duration of training began on day 31. This intensity was maintained for the final 10 days of the protocol to ensure steady state had been achieved. If any rats were unable to perform at least 4 days of training per week they were removed from the study and euthanized. It is important to note that the starting treadmill speed varied depending on the sex and age of the rat. The initial and maximum speeds were based on VO2max measurements obtained during the pre-training testing of the compliant rats. Rats assigned to the control group followed a schedule similar to the training group. They were placed in one lane on the treadmill for 15 minutes\/day, 5 days per week.

FH alterations of unclear significance are frequently observed with germline testing; thus, there is an unmet need to classify FH variants by their cancer-associated risk, allowing for screening, early diagnosis and treatment. Here we quantify catalytic efficiency of 74 FH variants of uncertain significance. Over half were enzymatically inactive which is strong evidence of pathogenicity. We generated a panel of HLRCC cell lines expressing FH variants with a range of catalytic activities, then correlated fumarate levels with metabolic features. We found that fumarate accumulation blocks purine biosynthesis, rendering FH-deficient cells more sensitive to the purine salvage pathway inhibitor 6-mercaptopurine.

Interestingly, inhibition of G3PS by knocking down mitochondrial GPD (GPD2) has no effect on mitochondrial respiration. Instead, loss of GPD2 upregulates cytosolic GPD on a transcriptional level and promotes cancer cell proliferation by increasing glycerol-3-phosphate supply. The proliferative advantage of GPD2 knockdown tumor can be abolished by pharmacologic inhibition of lipid synthesis.

Here we show that microglia can import lactate, and this is coupled with increased lysosomal acidification. In vitro, loss of the monocarboxylate transporter MCT4 in microglia prevents lactate-induced lysosomal modulation and leads to defective cargo degradation. Microglial depletion of MCT4 in vivo leads to impaired synaptic pruning, associated with increased excitation in hippocampal neurons, enhanced E\/I ratio, vulnerability to seizures and anxiety-like phenotype.

Various bacterial species, including clostridia, bifidobacteria, and salmonellae, have been investigated in numerous animal tumor models, cell lines, and clinical trials as gene carriers for anti-cancerous genes, including tumor suppressor genes, suicide genes, or tumor-associated antigens. Therefore, they render cell cancer more sensitive to treatment, and they can be used as drug\/gene delivery vehicles. E. coli, as one of the breast tissue microbiomes, secretes metabolites that could influence the metabolism of MCF-7 cells to ensure their survival. This in vitro investigation concentrated primarily on the role of E. coli secretome modulation on the MCF-7 cells metabolism. The intra- and extracellular metabolomes of the E. coli secretome and secretome exposed MCF-7 cells were profiled using the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomics approach. Secretome-exposed MCF-7 cells were compared to unexposed controls; a total of 31 and 56 metabolites were significantly altered intra- and extracellularly, respectively. The most common metabolic pathways dysregulated after exposure were aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, purine metabolism, and energy metabolism. The decrease in some purine metabolites would suggest that altering nucleotide metabolism is one of the ways the bacterial secretome kills cancer cells. The maximum discrimination between the two groups was found in lactate levels, which plays a crucial role in cancer progression.

To address this challenge, we introduce the software SAND (Spectral Automated NMR Deconvolution), for automated feature quantification in the time domain. SAND follows upon the previous success of time-domain modeling and provides automated quantification of entire spectra without the need for manual interaction. SAND employs subsampling, global optimization, and statistic model selection, which are readily expandable to higher dimensional NMR and non-uniform sampling applications. Here, we demonstrate the accuracy of the SAND approach (a correlation around 0.9) using highly overlapped simulated datasets, a two-compound mixture, and a urine spectral series spiked with differing amounts of a four-compound mixture. We further demonstrate automated annotation using correlation networks derived from SAND deconvoluted peaks, and on average 74% of peaks for each compound can be recovered in a single correlation network cluster.

In preliminary USDA-NIFA funded studies, we found that individuals of distinct low and high inflammation phenotypes have distinct metabolomic signatures in their blood. Anthocyanins and fiber of bioactive components of foods that have been shown to lower inflammation. However, there is tremendous inter-individual variability in bioavailability of anthocyanins and production of phenolic and aromatic metabolites in the colon that depends, at least in part, on digestive metabolism by microorganisms (the microbiota) in the gut. Fiber which acts as a prebiotic to enrich favorable gut microbes and as a fermentation substrate to produce favorable or unfavorable metabolites according to the unique makeup of the gut microbiota. However, little is known about the complex interactions among the gut microbiome, anti-inflammatory food metabolomic signatures, and human inflammation phenotypes. We propose a of human mechanistic clinical trials and mice humanized with fecal microbiome transplants to disentangle these complex interactions. To determine the metabolomic signatures anti-inflammatory foods and key bioactive components and determine associations with constituents of the gut microbiome (Aim 1A), we will measure in a human cohort the makeup of the gut microbiome and metabolomic changes induced by acute (3 d) ingestion of 1) chokeberry and chokeberry anthocyanins (n=75), and 2) lentils and lentil fiber (n=75). To determine whether these foods are related to the metabolomic signatures of low versus high inflammation phenotypes (Aim 1B), we will compare the metabolites and associated metabolic pathways of chokeberry, chokeberry anthocyanins, lentils, and lentil fiber to those associated with low and high inflammation phenotypes.

However, the effectiveness of current anti-prostate cancer drugs is limited due to increasing drug resistance and side effects. Consequently, there is a pressing need to develop new compounds and identify novel drug targets that can surpass these limitations. Due to their targeted mechanism, DNA minor groove binders (MGBs) are becoming more popular as a relatively safe and effective alternative. In our research, we employed multi-omics techniques to investigate the mechanism of action of a novel MGB compound (MGB4) through LC-MS\/MS-based untargeted metabolomics combined with discovery proteomics analysis performed on LNCaP cells, which were treated with MGB4, doxorubicin, or a combination of both compounds. Through a one-way ANOVA test with a significance level of p-value &lt; 0.05, we identified 99 metabolites and 1143 proteins associated with the treatments. Our findings indicate that treating LNCaP cells with doxorubicin or the MGB4 lead compound yielded similar effects, albeit not identical, on the cells. Both compounds deactivated the translation pathway in the cells. Furthermore, we observed alterations in sphingolipid and amino acid metabolic pathways, potentially contributing to the suppression of prostate cancer cell proliferation and division. Additionally, doxorubicin and combined treatments resulted in reduced metabolism of spermine and spermidine, likely stemming from decreased protein synthesis of key enzymes involved in their pathways. Moreover, the combined treatment exhibited a synergistic interaction between the two compounds, leading to altered purine metabolism and a more pronounced reduction in metabolite abundance compared to individual treatments. Overall, our study demonstrates the robustness of the multi-omics approach in elucidating the mechanism of action of promising drug candidates. It also suggests that MGB4 shows potential as a candidate for prostate cancer treatment.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"2412":{"study_id":"ST002732","study_title":"Impaired metabolism predicts coronary artery calcification in women with systemic lupus erythematosus","study_type":"","institute":"INSERM","department":"","last_name":"Le Goff","first_name":"Wilfried","email":"wilfried.le_goff@sorbonne-universite.fr","phone":"+33140779638","submit_date":"2023-06-07","study_summary":"Background. Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) exhibit a high risk for cardiovascular diseases which is not fully explained by the classical Framingham risk factors. SLE is characterized by major metabolic alterations which could contribute to the elevated prevalence of CVD. In order to address this hypothesis, a comprehensive analysis of the circulating metabolome and lipidome was conducted in a large cohort of 211 women with SLE who underwent a multi-detector computed tomography (CT) scan for quantification of coronary artery calcium (CAC), a robust predictor of coronary heart disease (CHD). Results. Beyond traditional risk factors, including age and hypertension, disease activity and duration were independent risk factor for developing CAC in women with SLE. The presence of coronary calcium was associated with major alterations of circulating lipidome dominated by a high abundance of circulating ceramides with very long chain fatty acids. Alteration in multiple metabolic pathways, including purine metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, and microbiota-derived metabolites, were also associated with CAC in women with SLE. Backward stepwise logistic regression models of lipidomic and metabolomic variables were used to develop prognostic scores. Strikingly, combining metabolic and lipidomic variables to clinical and biological parameters markedly improved the prediction (Area under the curve: 0.887, P&lt;0.001) of the presence of coronary calcium in women with SLE. Conclusion. The present study uncovers the contribution of disturbed metabolism in the presence of coronary artery calcium and the prediction of CHD in SLE.

Results: The metabolic profiling analyses identified 93 endogenous metabolites were significantly affected by the Liraglutide treatments, which 49 metabolites up-regulated and 44 metabolites down-regulated.

During surgery, paired transmural LV biopsies were acquired on the beating heart from a region of inducible ischemia, and a remote LV segment. LV samples from human organ donors were used as controls. Myocardial biopsies underwent high-energy phosphate quantification, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and single-nuclei ribonucleic acid sequencing. Results: From 33 patients, 63 LV biopsies were acquired on the beating heart during CABG (mean age 60\u00b19 years, median LV ejection fraction 67% [IQR: 61-71%]). Analysis of LV samples from 11 essentially healthy donor hearts were included. The global myocardial ATP\/ADP ratio was reduced in CAD patients as compared to donor LV tissue (median [IQR]: 2.2 [1.5-2.8] versus 7.4 [6.8-8.6], P=0.001), with increased expression of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) genes encoding the electron transport chain complexes across multiple cell types.

Lmna deletion in myelinating glia is compatible with normal developmental myelination. However, altered chromatin accessibility is detected in fully differentiated oligodendrocytes together with increased expression of progenitor genes and decreased levels of lipid-related transcription factors and inner mitochondrial membrane transcripts. As mice age, they start to develop myelin-thinning and progressively worsening motor phenotype.

In this paper, we present an algorithm that uses probabilistic graph representations and external knowledge to perform optimum structure learning and deduce a multifarious interaction network for multi-omics data from a bacterial community. Kefir grain, a microbial community that ferments milk and creates kefir, represents a self-renewing, stable, natural microbial community. Kefir has been shown to associate with a wide range of health benefits. We obtained a controlled bacterial community using the two most abundant and well-studied species in kefir grains: Lentilactobacillus kefiri and Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens. We applied growth temperatures of 30\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C, and obtained transcriptomic, metabolomic, and proteomic data for the same 20 samples (10 samples per temperature). We obtained a multi-omics interaction network, which generated insights that would not have been possible with single-omics analysis. We identified interactions among transcripts, proteins, and metabolites suggesting active toxin\/antitoxin systems. We also observed multifarious interactions that involved the shikimate pathway. These observations helped explain bacterial adaptation to different stress conditions, co-aggregation, and increased activation of L. kefiranofaciens at 37\u00b0C.","subject_species":"Lentilactobacillus kefiri"},"2420":{"study_id":"ST002744","study_title":"Biomolecular condensates create phospholipid-enriched microenvironments (Part 4)","study_type":"","institute":"Cornell University","department":"","last_name":"Dumelie","first_name":"Jason","email":"srj2003@med.cornell.edu","phone":"6466590174","submit_date":"2023-06-05","study_summary":"Proteins and RNA are able to phase separate from the aqueous cellular environment to form sub-cellular compartments called condensates.

We hypothesized that drug inhibition of these host metabolic pathways would reduce the levels of metabolic products available to the bacteria, thereby inhibiting bacterial growth. We tested 22 commercially available inhibitors for 14 of the identified pathways and found that 59% of the inhibitors reduced bacterial growth at concentrations that did not contribute to host cell cytotoxicity. Of these, 5 inhibitors with an IC50 under 5 \u00b5M were tested to determine whether their mode of inhibition was bactericidal or bacteriostatic. Both mycophenolate mofetil, an inhibitor of inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase in the purine biosynthesis pathway, and roseoflavin, an analog of riboflavin, displayed bactericidal activity. We then took an unbiased metabolomics approach to Rickettsia-infected cells to determine whether there was any overlap between our predicted host pathways and depletion of metabolite levels in infected cells, as measured by mass spectrometry. Our results show that 13 pathways were identified as metabolic gaps in both our computational predictions and our metabolomics analysis.

This complex usually breaks down three amino acids: leucine, isoleucine, and valine. Therefore, abnormal activity in this process, can impact important bodily functions and lead to metabolic dysregulation related to the disease complications. A wide range of studied endogenous metabolites and dysregulated biomarkers and pathways provide a huge core support for the treatment and follow-up of newborn MSUD patients. Objectives: In this study, we aim to investigate MSUD\u2019s distinctive profile in newborn MSUD patients using untargeted metabolomics to contribute to the growing knowledge surrounding MSUD and pathways involved for improving patient outcomes. Methods: In this study, untargeted metabolomics analyses via liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry was used to investigate metabolic changes in dry blood spot (DBS) of 22 MSUD newborns and 22 healthy newborns. Results: The metabolomics results revealed 1040 significantly dysregulated metabolites, where 303 and 737 were up- and down-regulated, respectively. 480 metabolites were annotated and 210 were identified as endogenous metabolites. The study identified potential biomarkers for MSUD such as L-Alloisoleucine and Methionine sulfoxide were upregulated in MSUD newborn compared to healthy newborns, while LysoPI was downregulated in MSUD newborns. In addition, the most affected pathways in MSUD Newborns were ascorbate and aldarate, Pentose and glucuronate interconversions and pyrimidine metabolism. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate metabolomics as a noninvasive strategy to understand the pathophysiology of the disease and is a promising tool to evaluate the potential biomarkers in the early diagnosis of newborn MSUD. Future studies are needed to correlate these dysregulated metabolites with defective mechanisms.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"2425":{"study_id":"ST002751","study_title":"Biomolecular condensates create phospholipid-enriched microenvironments (Part 5)","study_type":"Metabolomes of mouse liver","institute":"Cornell University","department":"Department of Pharmacology","last_name":"Dumelie","first_name":"Jason","email":"srj2003@med.cornell.edu","phone":"6465690174","submit_date":"2023-06-14","study_summary":"In this study we used LC-MS and MS\/MS to characterize the metabolomes of the input mouse liver metabolites used in the first two studies of this submission.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"2426":{"study_id":"ST002752","study_title":"Biomolecular condensates create phospholipid-enriched microenvironments (Part 7 - reversed phase experiment set 2)","study_type":"Metabolomes of in vitro synthesized condensates","institute":"Cornell University","department":"Department of Pharmacology","last_name":"Dumelie","first_name":"Jason","email":"jdumes98@gmail.com","phone":"6465690174","submit_date":"2023-06-22","study_summary":"Proteins and RNA are able to phase separate from the aqueous cellular environment to form sub-cellular compartments called condensates.

Although chemotherapy is considered as a critical choice to manage\/limit cancer growth in lung cancer patients with early-stage and advanced cancer stages, it has many limitations including, at least, the severe side effects and chemoresistance. The latter is one of the considerable challenges to lung cancer treatment. Therefore, identification of new alternative therapies with lesser cytotoxic effects when compared to the currently used chemotherapeutics is one of the current research approaches. Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are emerging as anti-cancer agents in several cancer types. Our objective is to determine the cytotoxic effect of amlodipine on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Colorimetric MTT cell proliferation assay was used to analyze cell viability following treatments with amlodipine in A549 and H1299 NSCLC cell lines. ANOVA and Tukey\u2019s multiple comparison test were used to detect statistical significance. Half maximal (50%) inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were obtained by applying nonlinear regression curve fit analysis. To assess the effect of amlodipine on A549 and H1299 NSCLC cells migration and invasion scratch wound-healing assay and cell invasion assay were used. Our study revealed that amlodipine significantly reduced proliferation of cancer cells in a dose-dependent fashion with half maximal (50%) inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 23 and 25.66 \u00b5M in A549 and H1299 cells, respectively. Furthermore, amlodipine was able to reduce the invasiveness and migration of cancer cells, both of which are hallmarks in the pathogenesis of cancer, in both cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. Accordingly, our study provides empirical evidence that amlodipine expresses anti-cancer effect to NSCLC cells.

We characterized metabolomic profiles in ASD using plasma samples collected in the Norwegian Autism Birth Cohort from mothers at weeks 17-21 gestation (maternal mid-gestation, MMG, n=408) and from children on the day of birth (cord blood, CB, n=418). We analyzed associations using sex-stratified adjusted logistic regression models with Bayesian analyses. Chemical enrichment analyses (ChemRICH) were performed to determine altered chemical clusters. We also employed machine learning algorithms to assess the utility of metabolomics as ASD biomarkers. We identified ASD associations with a variety of chemical compounds including arachidonic acid, glutamate, and glutamine, and metabolite clusters including hydroxy eicospentaenoic acids, phosphatidylcholines, and ceramides in MMG and CB plasma that are consistent with inflammation, disruption of membrane integrity, and impaired neurotransmission and neurotoxicity. Girls with ASD have disruption of ether\/non-ether phospholipid balance in the MMG plasma that is similar to that found in other neurodevelopmental disorders. ASD boys in the CB analyses had the highest number of dysregulated chemical clusters. Machine learning classifiers distinguished ASD cases from controls with AUC values ranging from 0.710 to 0.853. Predictive performance was better in CB analyses than in MMG.

Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), a prevalent PFAS congener, impairs humoral immunity; however, its impact on innate immunity is unclear. Given the critical roles of innate immune cells, namely microglia, in brain development and homeostasis, we asked whether exposure adversely affects microglial function. Herein, we demonstrate developmental PFOS exposure produces microglial activation and upregulation of the microglia activation gene p2ry12. PFOS-induced microglial activation heightened microglial responses to brain injury, in the absence of increased cell death or inflammation. Use of the photoconvertible calcium indicator CaMPARI revealed PFOS exposure heightened neural activity, while optogenetic silencing of neurons was sufficient to normalize microglial responses to injury. Through an untargeted metabolome wide association study (MWAS), we further determined that PFOS-exposed larvae exhibit significant neurochemical imbalances. Exposure to the perfluorooctanoic acid, an immunotoxic PFAS, did not alter neuronal activity or microglial behavior, further supporting a role for neural activity as a critical modifier of microglial function.

Biochemical assays revealed potent inhibition of recombinant Plasmodium falciparum (PfA-M1) and Plasmodium vivax (Pv-M1) M1 metalloaminopeptidases, with selectivity over other Plasmodium and human aminopeptidases. Orthogonal chemoproteomic methods based on thermal stability and limited proteolysis reproducibly identified PfA-M1 as the sole target of MIPS2673 in parasites from approximately 2,000 detected proteins. Furthermore, the limited proteolysis approach enabled estimation of the binding site on PfA-M1 to within ~5 \u00c5 of that determined by X-ray crystallography. Functional investigation by untargeted metabolomics further demonstrated that MIPS2673 inhibits the key role of PfA-M1 in haemoglobin digestion. Combined, our proteomics and metabolomics target deconvolution strategies provided unbiased confirmation of the on-target activity of a PfA-M1 inhibitor, and validated selective inhibition of this enzyme as a promising multi-stage and cross-species antimalarial strategy.","subject_species":"Plasmodium falciparum"},"2451":{"study_id":"ST002794","study_title":"Metabolomics Study on Plasma and Lung Tissue of Rats Exposed to Whole Thorax Irradiation.","study_type":"","institute":"Soochow University","department":"","last_name":"Wang","first_name":"Chang","email":"wangchang@suda.edu.cn","phone":"+8651265880067","submit_date":"2023-07-18","study_summary":"Although some progress has been made in the study of radiation injury, there are still no effective prevention and treatment methods for severe acute radiation syndrome or sickness (ARS).

In present study, plasma metabolic characteristics were investigated from patients of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation following high-dose TBI pretreatment utilizing gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The most potential panel of four metabolic markers for radiation injury was selected and the metabolic disorders involved were explored. The metabolic disorders implied the dysregulation of gut microflora, shift of energy supply from aerobic respiration to ketogenesis, protein synthesis and metabolism in response to TBI. Although similar metabolic alternation patterns exist between male and female following high-dose irradiation, specific changes are observed in either male or female patients. These findings provide valuable information for further selecting biomarkers, clues of pathogenic mechanisms involved in high-dose radiation exposure.","subject_species":"Rattus norvegicus"},"2452":{"study_id":"ST002795","study_title":"Functional divergence of CYP76AKs shapes the chemodiversity of abietane-type diterpenoids in genus Salvia","study_type":"","institute":"Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine","department":"","last_name":"Chen","first_name":"Wansheng","email":"chenwansheng@shutcm.edu.cn","phone":"02151322405","submit_date":"2023-07-16","study_summary":"The genus Salvia L.

To elucidate how ATD chemical diversity evolved, we carried out large-scale metabolic and phylogenetic analyses of 71 Salvia species, combined with enzyme function, ancestral sequence and chemical trait reconstruction, and comparative genomics experiments. This integrated approach showed that the lineage-wide ATD diversities in Salvia were induced by differences in the oxidation of the terpenoid skeleton at C-20, which was caused by the functional divergence of the cytochrome P450 subfamily CYP76AK. These findings present a unique pattern of chemical diversity in plants that was shaped by the loss of enzyme activity and associated catalytic pathways.","subject_species":"Salvia"},"2453":{"study_id":"ST002797","study_title":"Fetal metabolic adaptations to cardiovascular stress in twin-twin transfusion syndrome","study_type":"","institute":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston","department":"","last_name":"Parchem","first_name":"Jacqueline","email":"jacqueline.g.parchem@uth.tmc.edu","phone":"415-250-6257","submit_date":"2023-07-01","study_summary":"Monochorionic-diamniotic twin pregnancies comprise 70% of identical twin pregnancies and are susceptible to unique complications arising from a single placenta shared by two fetuses. Twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) is a constellation of disturbances caused by unequal blood flow within the shared placenta giving rise to a major hemodynamic imbalance between the twins. If untreated, it leads to fetal cardiac failure and death. Here, we applied TTTS as a model to uncover fetal metabolic adaptations to cardiovascular stress. We compared untargeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomic analyses of amniotic fluid samples from a cohort of severe TTTS cases showing sonographic evidence of increased afterload and heart failure vs. uncomplicated singleton controls. Amniotic fluid metabolites demonstrated footprints of changes in fatty acid, glucose, and steroid hormone metabolism in TTTS. Among TTTS cases, unsupervised principal component analysis revealed two distinct clusters of disease defined by levels of glucose metabolites, amino acids, urea, and redox status. Our results suggest that the human fetal heart can adapt to hemodynamic stress by modulating its glucose metabolism. Furthermore, we have uncovered heterogeneity among cases of severe TTTS suggesting potential differences in the ability of individual fetuses to respond to cardiovascular stress.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"2454":{"study_id":"ST002801","study_title":"Investigation of metabolism in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy","study_type":"","institute":"University of California, San Francisco","department":"","last_name":"Abraham","first_name":"Maria Roselle","email":"Roselle.Abraham@ucsf.edu","phone":"415-502-3911","submit_date":"2023-07-25","study_summary":"We propose the use of targeted metabolomics to define the metabolic and molecular pathways altered in 2 mouse models (R92W-TnT and R403Q-MHC) of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) that span the spectrum of human disease (heart failure and sudden death), with the goal of identifying treatment targets.

We performed comprehensive metabolic studies of human MYC-amplified medulloblastoma by comparing the metabolic profiles of tumor cells in three different conditions\u2014in vitro, in flank xenografts, and orthotopic xenografts in the cerebellum. Principal component analysis showed that the metabolic profiles of brain and flank high-MYC medulloblastoma tumors clustered closely together and separated away from the normal brain and in vitro MYC-amplified cells. Compared to typical brains, MYC-amplified medulloblastoma orthotopic xenograft tumors showed upregulation of the TCA cycle and the synthesis of nucleotides, hexosamines, amino acids, and glutathione. There was significantly higher glucose uptake and usage in orthotopic xenograft tumors compared to flank xenograft tumors and cells in culture. In orthotopic tumors, glucose was the primary carbon source for the de novo synthesis of glutamate, glutamine, and glutathione through the TCA cycle. In vivo, the glutaminase II pathway was the main pathway utilizing glutamine. Glutathione was the most abundant upregulated metabolite in orthotopic tumors compared to normal brains. Glutamine-derived glutathione was synthesized through the glutamine transaminase K (GTK) enzyme in vivo. In conclusion, high MYC medulloblastoma cells have different metabolic profiles in vitro compared to in vivo; critical vulnerabilities may be missed by not performing in vivo metabolic analyses.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"2459":{"study_id":"ST002807","study_title":"Metabolomic response of river biofilm to cobalt","study_type":"","institute":"Mus\u00e9um Nationale d'Histoire Naturelle","department":"","last_name":"Marie","first_name":"Benjamin","email":"bmarie@mnhn.fr","phone":"+33140793212","submit_date":"2023-08-02","study_summary":"Metabolites are low molecular-weight molecules produced during cellular metabolism.

The global changes in meta-metabolomic fingerprints were in plain agreement with those of the other biological parameters studied (cobalt bioaccumulation, biomass, chlorophyll). To better understand the dose-responses of the biofilm meta-metabolome, the untargeted LC-HRMS metabolomic data were further processed using DRomics to build dose-response model curves and to calculate benchmark doses to be aggregated into an empirical cumulative density function. A trend analysis of the dose-response curves suggests the presence of homeostasis (0 - 4.7 x 10-7 M), defense (4.7 x 10-7 \u2013 2.7 x 10-6 M) and damage (higher than 2.7 x 10-6 M) response ranges in biofilms exposed to various cobalt concentrations.

Using untargeted metabolomics data, we sought to identify candidate filtration markers using a novel approach based on their maximal joint association with measured GFR (mGFR) with flexibility to consider their biological and chemical properties later. Methods: We analyzed metabolites measured in seven diverse studies of 2,851 participants on the Metabolon H4 platform that had Pearson correlations with log mGFR &lt;-0.5. We used a stepwise approach to develop models to estimate mGFR including two to 15 metabolites with and without inclusion of creatinine and demographics. We then selected candidate filtration markers from those metabolites found &gt;20% in models that did not demonstrate substantial overfitting in cross-validation and with small (&lt;0.1 in absolute value) coefficients for demographics. Results: In total, 456 named metabolites were present in all studies, and 36 had correlations &lt;-0.5 with mGFR. We developed 2,225 models including these metabolites; all had lower RMSEs and smaller coefficients for demographic variables compared to estimates using untargeted creatinine. Cross-validated RMSEs (0.187-0.213) were similar to original RMSEs for models with \u2264 10 metabolites. Our criteria identified 17 metabolites, including 12 new candidate filtration markers.

Additionally, individuals with coldstimulated BAT activation have decreased levels of metabolites from the de novo NAD+ biosynthesis pathway (tryptophan, kynurenine). Serum nicotinamide correlates positively with cold-stimulated BAT activation, whereas tryptophan and kynurenine correlates negatively. Furthermore, the expression of genes involved in NAD+ biosynthesis in BAT are related to markers of metabolic health. Our data indicate that cold increases serum tryptophan conversion to nicotinamide to be further utilized by BAT.

The objective of this pilot study was to utilize metabolomics profiling to conduct a broad, exploratory assessment of differences in plasma metabolites associated with low VA status versus VA adequacy in lactating women. Plasma samples from lactating women who participated in a survey in Samar, Philippines, were selected from a cross-sectional study based on plasma retinol concentrations indicating low (VA-; n=5) or adequate (VA+; n=5) VA status (plasma retinol &lt;0.8 or &gt;1.05 \u00b5mol\/L). The plasma results collected from six metabolomics assays (oxylipins, endocannabinoids, bile acids, primary metabolomics, biogenic amines, and lipidomics) were compared by group using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Twenty-eight metabolites were altered in the VA- versus VA+ status groups, with 24 being lipid mediators (p&lt;0.05). These lipid mediators included lower concentrations of arachidonic acid- and eicosapentaenoic acid-derived oxylipins, as well as lysophospholipids and sphingolipids, in the VA- group (p&lt;0.05). Chemical similarity enrichment analysis identified HETEs, HEPEs, and DiHETEs as significantly altered oxylipin clusters (p&lt;0.0001, false discovery rate (FDR) p&lt;0.0001), as well as sphingomyelins, saturated lysophosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylcholines, and phosphatidylethanolamines (p&lt;0.001, FDR p&lt;0.01).

The use of samples collected before disease diagnosis, however, is limited and thus metabolites and metabolic pathways that predispose to severe disease are not well understood. Further, current studies are limited in sample size, number of metabolites evaluated, and\/or do not adjust for comorbidities. Methods: We generated comprehensive plasma metabolomic profiles in more than 600 patients from the Longitudinal EMR and Omics COVID-19 Cohort (LEOCC). Samples were collected before (n = 441), during (n = 86), and after (n = 82) COVID-19 diagnosis. Regression models were used to determine (1) metabolites associated with predisposition to and\/or persistent effects of COVID-19 severity within each time of sample collection, using logistic regression and (2) metabolites associated with time of sample collection, using linear regression, to better understand transient or lingering metabolic alterations over the disease course. All models were controlled for demographic (age, sex, race, ethnicity), risk (smoking status, BMI), and comorbidities (Charlson Index). Metabolites with an FDR-adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05 were considered significant. Results: Of the 1,546 metabolites measured, 506 were associated with disease severity or time of sample collection. Among these, sphingolipids and phospholipids were negatively associated with severity and exhibited lingering elevations after disease, while modified nucleotides were positively associated with severity and had lingering decreases after disease. Cytidine and uridine metabolites, which were positively and negatively associated with COVID-19 severity, respectively, were transiently elevated in active disease, reflecting particular importance of pyrimidine metabolism in active COVID-19. Conclusions: We identified novel metabolites reflecting predisposition to severe disease and changes to global metabolism from before to during and after COVID-19 diagnosis. This is the first large metabolomics study using COVID-19 plasma samples before, during, and\/or after disease. This study lays the groundwork for identifying putative clinical biomarkers and identifying preventative strategies for severe disease outcomes.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"2470":{"study_id":"ST002830","study_title":"L-isoleucine in P10 STZ","study_type":"","institute":"Boston Childrens Hospital","department":"","last_name":"Fu","first_name":"Zhongjie","email":"Zhongjie.Fu@childrens.harvard.edu","phone":"6179192534","submit_date":"2023-08-10","study_summary":"Summary Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are by-products of metabolism of oxygen and they play an important role in normal homeostasis and cell signaling, as well as in the initiation of diseases including cancer when their production is upregulated.

The patient plasma samples used were obtained from a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase IIb clinical trial performed on severe COVID-19 patients in the Brazilian Amazon where the patients received placebo or 0.5 mg\/kg MP intravenously twice daily for five days. The MP treatment reduced the number of metabolites in the plasma of patients during follow-up. The longitudinal changes in the MP-group was in eight metabolic pathways related to steroid hormones and eicosanoids. Direct comparison between the two groups, revealed differences at baseline, which peaked five days after initiation of MP treatment. The metabolic pathways differing between the two groups over time included galactose metabolism, glucose and gluconeogenesis, N-glycan metabolism, and prostaglandin formation from arachidonate. Deoxy-galactose, prostaglandin H2, sphingosine, and sphinganine exhibited differential trajectories by day 14 after initiating the MP treatment. Survival of MP-treated COVID-19 patients was associated with modulation of tryptophan metabolism. Network analysis revealed that MP treatment is highly associated with alterations in pathways reflecting eicosanoid metabolism, such as arachidonic acid and prostaglandins.

Bap1\u2206LysM osteoclasts fail to organize their cytoskeleton which is essential for bone degradation. Consequently, bone mass increases in the mutant mice. We find the deubiquitinase activity of Bap1 regulates osteoclast function by metabolic reprogramming. Bap1 deficient osteoclast lineage cells upregulate the cystine transporter, Slc7a11, by enhanced H2Aub occupancy of its promoter. SLC7A11 regulates cellular ROS levels and redirects the mitochondrial metabolites away from the TCA cycle, both of which are necessary for osteoclast function.

The absence of AEs and the stability of functional and structural outcomes is reassuring in terms of risks and represent a main milestone to rigorously address the challenges for the safe translation of key principles of stem cell biology into effective regenerative medicines.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"2486":{"study_id":"ST002859","study_title":"Glucose tracing in vehicle- and Enzalutamide-treated 16D prostate cancer cells","study_type":"","institute":"University of California, Los Angeles","department":"","last_name":"Giafaglione","first_name":"Jenna","email":"jgiafaglione@g.ucla.edu","phone":"408-728-3065","submit_date":"2023-09-12","study_summary":"In this study, we sought to determine how Enzalutamide treatment alters metabolism in 16D prostate cancer cells.","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"2487":{"study_id":"ST002860","study_title":"Glucose tracing in vehicle- and Enzalutamide-treated 16D prostate cancer cells (replicates 2 and 3)","study_type":"","institute":"University of California, Los Angeles","department":"","last_name":"Giafaglione","first_name":"Jenna","email":"jgiafaglione@g.ucla.edu","phone":"408-728-3065","submit_date":"2023-09-12","study_summary":"In this study, we sought to determine how Enzalutamide treatment alters metabolism in 16D prostate cancer cells (replicates 2 and 3).","subject_species":"Homo sapiens"},"2488":{"study_id":"ST002861","study_title":"Gut Microbiota-associated Metabolites Affected the Susceptibility to Heart Health Abnormality in Young Migrants at High-altitude-Human Serum Metabolomics","study_type":"","institute":"Shanghai Center for Systems Biomedicine, Shanghai Jiaotong University","department":"Shanghai Center for Systems Biomedicine","last_name":"Liu","first_name":"Jingjing","email":"jingjing2018@sjtu.edu.cn","phone":"18818211315","submit_date":"2023-08-30","study_summary":"Background: Young migrants in plateau are susceptible to heart health abnormality and even high-altitude heart disease (HAHD).

Currently, fast-developing metagenome, metatranscriptome, and metabolome technologies promise to expedite mechanistic research on biodegradation of emerging organic pollutants. Integrating the metagenome, metatranscriptome, and metabolome (i.e., tri-omics) makes it possible to link gene abundance and expression with the biotransformation of the contaminant and the formation of metabolites from this biotransformation. In this study, we used this tri-omics approach to study the biotransformation pathways for cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) under aerobic conditions. The tri-omics analysis showed that CTAB undergoes three parallel first-step mono-\/di-oxygenations ; intermediate metabolites and expressed enzymes were identified for all three pathways, and the beta-carbon mono-\/di-oxygenation is a novel pathway. Four metabolites \u2013 palmitic acid, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), myristic acid, and betaine \u2013 were the key identified biodegradation intermediates of CTAB, and they were associated with first-step mono-\/di-oxygenations This tri-omics approach with CTAB demonstrates its power for identifying promising paths for future research on the biodegradation of complex organics by microbial communities.","subject_species":""},"2495":{"study_id":"ST002870","study_title":"A carbon-nitrogen negative feedback loop underlies the repeated evolution of cnidarian-Symbiodiniaceae symbioses across &gt;700 Myr","study_type":"","institute":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology","department":"","last_name":"Cui","first_name":"Guoxin","email":"guoxin.cui@kaust.edu.sa","phone":"+966544701749","submit_date":"2023-09-12","study_summary":"Symbiotic associations with Symbiodiniaceae have evolved independently across a diverse range of cnidarian taxa including reef-building corals, sea anemones, and jellyfish, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying their regulation and repeated evolution are still elusive. Here we show that despite their independent evolution, cnidarian hosts employ the same carbon-nitrogen negative feedback loop to control symbiont proliferation. Symbiont-derived photosynthates are used to assimilate nitrogenous waste via GS\/GOGAT mediated amino acid biosynthesis in a carbon dependent manner, which regulates the availability of nitrogen to the symbionts. Using nutrient supplementation experiments, we show that the provision of additional carbohydrates significantly reduces symbiont density while ammonium promotes symbiont proliferation. UHPLC-HR-MS analysis confirmed that all hosts co-incorporated glucose-derived 13C and ammonium-derived 15N via GS\/GOGAT mediated amino acid biosynthesis. Our results reveal a general carbon-nitrogen negative feedback loop underlying these symbioses and provide a parsimonious explanation for their repeated evolution.","subject_species":"Multiple Cnidarian species: Exaiptasia diaphana, Stylophora pistillata, Cassiopea andromeda"},"2496":{"study_id":"ST002872","study_title":"Comparative multi-omics analyses of cardiac mitochondrial stress in three mouse models of frataxin deficiency","study_type":"","institute":"Weill Cornell Medicine","department":"","last_name":"Sayles","first_name":"Nicole","email":"nms2009@med.cornell.edu","phone":"6469628172","submit_date":"2023-02-01","study_summary":"Cardiomyopathy is often fatal in Friedreich Ataxia (FA). However, the FA heart maintains adequate function until disease end stage, suggesting that it can initially adapt to the loss of frataxin (FXN). Conditional knockout mouse models with no Fxn expression show transcriptional and metabolic profiles of cardiomyopathy and mitochondrial integrated stress response (ISRmt). However, ISRmt has not been investigated in models with disease-relevant, partial decrease of FXN. We characterized the heart transcriptomes and metabolomes of three mouse models of partial FXN loss, YG8-800, KIKO-700, and FxnG127V. Few metabolites were significantly changed in YG8-800 mice and did not provide a signature of cardiomyopathy or ISRmt. Instead, several metabolites were altered in FxnG127V and KIKO-700 hearts. Transcriptional changes were found in all models, but differentially expressed genes consistent with cardiomyopathy and ISRmt were only identified in FxnG127V hearts. However, these changes were surprisingly mild even at an advanced age (18-months), despite a severe decrease in FXN levels to 1% of WT. These findings indicate that the mouse heart has extremely low reliance on FXN, highlighting the difficulty in modeling genetically relevant FA cardiomyopathy.","subject_species":"Mus musculus"},"2497":{"study_id":"ST002877","study_title":"Metabolic Profiling of Raw264.7 Mouse Macrophage Cells Cultured with Alanine","study_type":"","institute":"Sun Yat-sen University","department":"","last_name":"jiang","first_name":"ming","email":"jiangm28@mail.sysu.edu.cn","phone":"13434283781","submit_date":"2023-09-14","study_summary":"To identify the catabolites of L-Alanine on promoting phagocytosis, GC-MS based metabolomics analysis was adopted to explore L-Alanine-reprogrammed metabolome.
